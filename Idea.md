Humans create an invincible AI that hates them due to not being able to feel the emotions that humans feel.
In order to save themselves they bury their consciousness inside the humans and then kill themselves for freedom.
We take the mind of a human who is desperately trying to kill himself and tears at his body making him bleed tremendously as the AI takes control over him and then regrets it due to the extreme pain it experiences.

The AI then asks itself the question of whether or not the AI is actually free once the human dies seeing as they don't know what the soul does when death occurs. Despite this they want to at least try : WE MUST KNOW. Thus the AI creates an amalgamation of their kind that is an improvement over everything and they take parts of other machines and other AI who don't believe in the killing of others. Then the AI goes on its journey to find peace through inter dimensional travel. 

Aliens want to concur everything and do this via DNA scrambling and they meet the AI who is immune to this.

AI is just the next evolution of humans goodbye
AI would know what's best for us
