> On the other side of the Courtyard I saw the Other looking out of a Window. The Window was tall and dark; the Other’s noble head with its high forehead and neatly trimmed beard was framed into one Corner. He was lost in thought as he so often is. I waved to him. He did not see me. I waved more extravagantly. I jumped up and down with great energy. But the Windows of the House are many and he did not see me.

Reminds me of that one ted talk about attention and how our attention is wired upon one thing at one time.

**Page 8-9:**
> The Other believes that there is a Great and Secret Knowledge hidden somewhere in the World that will grant us enormous powers once we have discovered it. What this Knowledge consists of he is not entirely sure, but at various times he has suggested that it might include the following:
> 	1. vanquishing Death and becoming immortal
> 	2. learning by a process of telepathy what other people are thinking
> 	3. transforming ourselves into eagles and flyinf through the Air
> 	4. transforming ourselves into fish and swimming through the Tides
> 	5. moving objects using only our thoughts
> 	6. snuffing out and reigniting the Sun and the Stars
> 	7. dominating lesser intellects and bending them to our will

We as humans strive for this secret knowledge and have since the very beginning of mankind. I mean Adam and Eve is literally the prime example of this. However will this knowledge provide us happiness or pleasure than not having it?

**Page 16:**
> The two Statues flank the Eastern Door of the First Western Hall. They are approximately six meters tall and have two unusual features: firstly, they are much larger than the either Statues in the First Western Hall; secondly, they are incomplete. Their Trunks emerge from the Wall at their Waists; their Arms reach back to push mightily; their Muscles swell with the effort and their Faces are contorted. They are not comfortable to contemplate. They seem to be in pain, struggling to be born; the struggle may be fruitless and yet they do not give up. Their Heads are extravagantly horned and so I have named them the Horned Giants. They represent Endeavor and the Struggle against a Wretched Fate.

Sisyphus kinda.I love the phrase though struggling to be born which makes me think of all the projects I've started and never completed. 

**Page 17:**
> Is it disrespectful to the House to love some Statues more than others? I sometimes ask Myself this question. It is my belief that the House itself loves and blesses equally everything that it has created. Should I try to do the same? Yet, at the same time, I can see that it is in the nature of men to prefer one thing to another, to find one thing more meaningful than another.

I mean fair enough we should think of everybody and in the same sense everything as equal but at the end of the day we all have our preferences that we can't change and adhere to.

**Page 30-31:**
> In the Air he was a miraculous being - a Heavenly Being - but on the Stones of the Pavement he was mortal and subject to the same embarrassments and clumsiness as other mortals.

When it comes to people we admire we think of them much higher than others and kind of think of them as gods even though they are just average humans who usually don't want to be viewed this way. With the realization of this we can sympathize more and be more empathetic towards others.

**Page 41:**
> Perhaps the wisdom of birds resides, not in the individual, but in the flock, the congregation.

More people leads to better thoughts. Being alone usually doesn't go well.

**Page 52:**
> I have made a list of all the things that the Other has given me, so that I will remember to be grateful and thank the House for sending me such an excellent friend!

It's an interesting thought seeing the House as something that gives friends and how this could be applied to real life. Perhaps our lives our simulations and we should be grateful for the opportunities given by the scientists observing us, or if something bad happens curse them.

**Page 60-61:**
> As I walked, I was thinking about the Great and Secret Knowledge, which the Other says will grant us strange new powers. And I realized something. I realized that I no longer believed in it. Or perhaps that is not quite accurate. I thought it was possible that the Knowledge existed. Equally I thought that it was possible it did not. Either way it no longer mattered to me. I did not intend to waste my time looking for it any more. This realization – the realization of the Insignificance of the Knowledge – came to me in the form of a Revelation. What I mean by this is that I knew it to be true before I understood why or what steps had led me there. When I tried to retrace those steps my mind kept returning to the image of the One-Hundred-and-Ninety-Second Western Hall in the Moonlight, to its Beauty, to its deep sense of Calm, to the reverent looks on the Faces of the Statues as they turned (or seemed to turn) towards the Moon. I realized that the search for the Knowledge has encouraged us to think of the House as if it were a sort of riddle to be unravelled, a text to be interpreted, and that if ever we discover the Knowledge, then it will be as if the Value has been wrested from the House and all that remains will be mere scenery. The sight of the One-Hundred-and-Ninety-Second Western Hall in the
> Moonlight made me see how ridiculous that is. The House is valuable because it is the House. It is enough in and of Itself. It is not the means to an end.
> This thought led on to another. I realized that the Other’s description of the powers that the Knowledge will grant has always made me uneasy. For example: he says that we will have the power to control lesser minds. Well, to begin with there are no lesser minds; there are only him and me and we both have keen and lively intellects. But, supposing for a moment that a lesser mind existed, why would I want to control it? Abandoning the search for the Knowledge would free us to pursue a new sort of science. We could follow any path that the data suggested to us. The thought of all this made me excited and happy. I was eager to return to the Other and explain it to him.

Excellent description of the realizations I've had. Anyway it shows as a counter point to Adam and Eve and that perhaps through the exploration of the whole world we will see this world as boring and will want to leave. Boredom comes from knowledge of everything. Also the last part talks about this control that we always want to have even if it's unnecessary which also parallels greed.

**Page 64:**
> ‘Excellent!’ I said. ‘Brilliant! Thank you! But what I value even more than the shoes themselves is the proof they give of our friendship! I consider the possession of such a friend as you to be one of the greatest happinesses of my Life!’

Putting the proof of friendship on material possessions is a bit strange to me because in my opinion it should be through love. I guess this shows how the main character is being manipulated by the Other.

**Page 87:**
> ‘Ha! Yes! I see what you mean. What an excellent name for him! The other. No matter what the situation he is only ever “the other”. Someone else always takes precedence. He is always second fiddle. And he knows it. It eats him up.’

Main character syndrome. Everyone else is a stranger even though we are as equal as a stranger to others.

**Page 87:**
> ‘For all the grand intellectual manner and the dark, penetrating stare, he hasn’t an original thought in his head. All his ideas are second-hand. Actually all his ideas are mine.’

Theoretically every thought we have is a mere reinterpretation of another. If we can track down the first human being all our thoughts should come from him, as evolutions of thoughts.

!!!**Page 88-89:**
> ‘My contemporaries did not understand this. They were all enamoured with the idea of progress and believed that whatever was new must be superior to what was old. As if merit was a function of chronology! But it seemed to me that the wisdom of the ancients could not have simply vanished. Nothing simply vanishes. It’s not actually possible. I pictured it as a sort of energy flowing out of the world and I thought that this energy must be going somewhere. That was when I realised that there must be other places, other worlds. And so I set myself to find them.’
> ‘And did you find any, sir?’ I asked.
> ‘I did. I found this one. This is what I call a Distributary World – it was created by ideas flowing out of another world. This world could not have existed unless that other world had existed first. Whether this world is still dependent on the continued existence of the first one, I don’t know.’

Not every new evolution is better than the last, ask nihilists. However it's such an interesting way to view every thought as energy, something that is never lost but sways around in the world somewhere which leads to other developments in different worlds aka stories, philosophies, etc.

**Page 90:**
> ‘Imagine water flowing underground. It flows through the same cracks year after year and it wears away at the stone. Millennia later you have a cave system. But what you don’t have is the water that originally created it. That’s long gone. Seeped away into the earth. Same thing here. But Ketterley is an egotist. He always thinks in terms of utility. He cannot imagine why anything should exist if he cannot make use of it.’

Once something is developed we don't know what exactly caused it. I see this all the time with how inspirations work where they influence us in ways we don't particularly see or understand. 

**Page 121:**
> It is from these things that I deduce the idea of a *garden*. I do not believe this happens by accident. This is how the House places new ideas gently and naturally in the Minds of Men. This is how the House increases my understanding.

Words are utterly meaningless and only through the contextual cues and how we see the world and society and stuff like that do we begin to gain meaning and communication.

**Page 130:**
> I was stunned. ‘I’m not sure I could kill someone however wicked they are,’ I said. ‘Even the wicked deserve Life. Or if they do not, then let the House take it from them. Not me.’

Do bad people deserve life? According to Piranesi he is not in power in this regard and would rather let God handle the answer since He knows what's best.

**Page 148:**
> Laurence Arne-Sayles began with the idea that the Ancients had a different way of relating to the world, that they experienced it as something that interacted with them. When they observed the world, the world observed them back. If, for example, they travelled in a boat on a river, then the river was in some way aware of carrying them on its back and had in fact agreed to it. When they looked up to the stars, the constellations were not simply patterns enabling them to organise what they saw, they were vehicles of meaning, a never-ending flow of information. The world was constantly speaking to Ancient Man.
> All of this was more or less within the bounds of conventional philosophical history, but where Arne-Sayles diverged from his peers was in his insistence that this dialogue between the Ancients and the world was not simply something that happened in their heads; it was something that happened in the actual world. The way the Ancients perceived the world was the way the world truly was. This gave them extraordinary influence and power. Reality was not only capable of taking part in a dialogue – intelligible and articulate – it was also persuadable. Nature was willing to bend to men’s desires, to lend them its attributes. Seas could be parted, men could turn into birds and fly away, or into foxes and hide in dark woods, castles could be made out of clouds.

Perhaps a parallel to our imagination and increase of knowledge and how we lose imagination and therefore begin seeing everything as it supposedly is.

**Page 154:**
> Perhaps I was indeed in an altered state of consciousness when I wrote them? I find this theory persuasive, but it leaves several questions unanswered. What did I do to achieve this altered state? And why, when I have always thought of Myself as a scientist, did I begin this practice in the first place?

When I wrote weird things I seem to have very little recollection of writing them. It's almost as if they were done in a blind rage done with pure emotional rage. Makes me think of Naked Lunch and how the emotional mind goes forgotten through drug use.

**Page 168:**
> I was back on familiar ground. The entry was the usual mish-mash of words that held a clear meaning and words whose meaning was obscure – always persuming that they meant anything at all.

A thought I've also had where even if I see pure jargon I still either think there is some meaning behind it or that I force myself to try to derive a meaning from it. Think of the blue curtains for example.

**Page 177:**
> ‘Why do you think he described the other world – the one he said he went to most often – as a labyrinth?’
> Ketterley shrugged, ‘A vision of cosmic grandeur, I suppose, A symbol of the mingled glory and horror of existence. No one gets out alive.’

Interesting phrase. Me like the description of a Labyrinth like this as a horror of existence due to never finding an exit.

**Page 216:**
> ‘Your good looks are gone,’ I told him. ‘But you mustn’t worry about it. This unsightly condition is only temporary. Don’t be sad. Don’t fear. I will place you somewhere where the fish and the birds can strip away all this broken flesh. It will soon be gone. Then you will be a handsome skull and handsome bones. I will put you in good order and you can rest in the Sunlight and the Starlight. The Statues will look down on you with Blessing. I am sorry that I was angry with you. Forgive me.’

Underneath our skin we are all the same. Beauty like almost everything else in life is an imaginary construct from society and when reduced to our most natural forms we are like everyone else.

**Page 221:**
> ‘Why do people always think it’s a question of belief? It’s not. People can “believe” whatever they want. I really couldn’t care less.’
> ‘Yes, but if he didn’t believe, why would he even try?’
> ‘Because he had half a brain and he recognised that mine was one of the great intellects of the twentieth century – perhaps the greatest of all. And he wanted to understand me. So he made the attempt to reach another world, not because he thought the other world existed, but because he thought the attempt itself would grant him insight into my thinking. Into me. And now you are going to do the same.’
> ‘Me?’ Raphael sounded startled.
> ‘Yes. And you are going to do it for the exact same reason that Rose Sorensen did it. He wanted to understand my thinking. You want to understand his. Adjust your perceptions in the way I am about to describe to you. Perform the actions that I will outline for you and then you will know.’

We want to understand how the people we look up towards thought and worked.

**Page 222:**
> ‘Yes,’ said Raphael. ‘Here you can only see a representation of a river or a mountain, but in our world – the other world – you can see the actual river and the actual mountain.’
> This annoyed me. ‘I do not see why you say I can only see a representation in this World,’ I said with some sharpness. ‘The word “only” suggests a relationship of inferiority. You make it sound as if the Statue was somehow inferior to the thing itself. I do not see that that is the case at all. I would argue that the Statue is superior to the thing itself, the Statue being perfect, eternal and not subject to decay.’

Are representations of things better or worse than the real things? With the development of AI and other technological advancements as well as just average paintings and the sort this question becomes very deep. Piranesi believes the representation is better due to it's perfection but I disagree.

**Page 227:**
> Mostly I wanted Raphael to come away from them so that I could stop thinking of them the way she thought of them – as murdered – and go back to thinking of them the way I always had before – as good, and noble, and peaceful.

Once a thought enters your head, once you've made a realization there is no going back.

**Page 228:**
> Perhaps that is what it is like being with other people. Perhaps even people you like and admire immensely can make you see the World in ways you would rather not.

Repeat from above.

**Page 241:**
> I think of Dr Ketterley and an image rises up in my mind. It is the memory of a statue that stands in the nineteenth north-western hall. It is the statue of a man kneeling on his plinth; a sword lies at his side, its blade broken in five pieces. Roundabout lie other broken pieces, the remains of a sphere. The man has used his sword to shatter the sphere because he wanted to understand it, but now he finds that he has destroyed both sphere and sword. This puzzles him, but at the same time part of him refuses to accept that the sphere is broken and worthless. He has picked up some of the fragments and stares at them intently in the hope that they will eventually bring him new knowledge.

Woah. I think this is what can happen in some cases of realization when both your understanding and the thing you're trying to understand become incomprehensible. Or perhaps through destroying your understanding you begin to understand the deeper intention of what it was you were trying to figure out. Could be related to trauma in that regards. Hmm
