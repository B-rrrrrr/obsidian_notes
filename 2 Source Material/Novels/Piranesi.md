> On the other side og the Courtyard I saw the Other looking out of a Window. The Window was tall and dark; the Otherâ€™s noble head with its high forehead and neatly trimmed beard was framed into one Corner. He was lost in thought as he so often is. I waved to him. He did not see me. I waved more extravagantly. I jumped up and down with great energy. But the Windows of the House are many and he did not see me.

> The Other believes that there is a Great and Secret Knowledge hidden somewhere in the World that will grant us enourmous powers once we jave discovered it. What this Knowledge consists of he is not entirely sure, but at various times he has suggested that it might include the following:
> 	1. vanquishing Death and becoming immortal
> 	2. learning by a process of telepathy what other people are thinking
> 	3. transforming ourselves into eagles and flyinf through the Air
> 	4. transforming ourselves into fish and swimming through the Tides
> 	5. moving objects using only our thoughts
> 	6. snuffing out and reigniting the Sun and the Stars
> 	7. dominating lesser intellects and bending them to our will

They are approximately six metres tall and have two unusual features: firstly, they are much larger than the ither Statues in the First Western Hall; secondly, they are incomplete. Their Trunks emerge from the Wall at their Waists; their Arms reach back to push mightily; their Muscles swell with the effort and their Faces are contorted. They are not comfortable to contemplate. They seem to be in pain, struggling to be born; the struggle may be fruitless and yet they do not give up. Their Heads are extravagantly horned and so I have named them the Horned Giants. They represent Endeavour and the Struggle against a Wretched Fate.

> Is it disrespectful to the House to love some Statues more than others? I sometimes ask Myself this question. It is my belief that the House itself loves and blesses equally everything that it has created. Should I try to do the same? Yet, at the same time, I can see that it is in the nature of men to prefer one thing to another, to find one thing more meaningful than another.
