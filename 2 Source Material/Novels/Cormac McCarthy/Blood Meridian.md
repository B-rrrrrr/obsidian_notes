I'll stand for my own witness, said Webster, but by now the
others had begun to call to him his conceit, and who would want
to see his bloody portrait anyway and would there be fights break
out in the great crowds awaiting its unveiling and perhaps they
could tar and feather the picture, lacking the article itself. Until
the judge raised his hand and called for amnesty and told them
that Webster's feelings were of a different kind and not motivated
by vanity at all and that he'd once drawn an old Hueco's portrait
and unwittingly chained the man to his own likeness. For he could
not sleep for fear an enemy might take it and deface it and so like
was the portrait that he would not suffer it creased nor anything
to touch it and he made a journey across the desert with it to
where he'd heard the judge was to be found and he begged his
counsel as to how he might preserve the thing and the judge took
him deep into the mountains and they buried the portrait in the
floor of a cave where it lies yet for aught the judge knew.
When he was done telling this Webster spat and wiped his
mouth and eyed the judge again. That man, he said, was no more
than a ignorant heathen savage.
That's so, said the judge.
It aint like that with me.
Excellent, said the judge, reaching for his portmanteau. You've
no objection to a sketch then?
I'll sit for no portrait, said Webster. But it aint like you said.

Five wagons smoldered on the desert floor and the riders
dismounted and moved among the bodies of the dead argonauts
in silence, those right pilgrims nameless among the stones with
their terrible wounds, the viscera spilled from their sides and the
naked torsos bristling with arrowshafts. Some by their beards
were men but yet wore strange menstrual wounds between their
legs and no man's parts for these had been cut away and hung
dark and strange from out their grinning mouths. In their wigs of
dried blood they lay gazing up with ape's eyes at brother sun now
rising in the east.

 When the kid selected among
the shafts to draw one he saw the judge watching him and he
paused. He looked at Glanton. He let go the arrow he'd chosen
and sorted out another and drew that one. It carried the red
tassel. He looked at the judge again and the judge was not
watching and he moved on and took his place with Tate and
Webster.

By noon they were abroad again, wandering red-eyed in the
streets, fitted out for the most part in new shirts and breeches.
They collected the remaining horses from the farrier and he stood
them to a drink. He was a small sturdy man named Pacheco and
he had for anvil an enormous iron meteorite shaped like a great
molar and the judge on a wager lifted the thing and on a further
wager lifted it over his head. Several men pushed forward to feel
the iron and to rock it where it stood, nor did the judge lose this
opportunity to ventilate himself upon the ferric nature of heavenly
bodies and their powers and claims. Two lines were drawn in the
dirt ten feet apart and a third round of wagers was laid, coins
from half a dozen countries in both gold and silver and even a few
boletas or notes of discounted script from the mines near Tubac.
The judge seized that great slag wandered for what millennia
from what unreckonable corner of the universe and he raised it
overhead and stood tottering and then lunged forward. It cleared
the mark by a foot and he shared with no one the specie piled on
the saddleblanket at the farrier's feet for not even Glanton had
been willing to underwrite this third trial.

**Page 153:**
Now this son whose father's existence in this world
is historical and speculative even before the son has entered it is
in a bad way. All his life he carries before him the idol of a
perfection to which he can never attain. The father dead has
euchered the son out of his patrimony. For it is the death of the
father to which the son is entitled and to which he is heir, more so
than his goods. He will not hear of the small mean ways that
tempered the man in life. He will not see him struggling in follies
of his own devising. No. The world which he inherits bears him
false witness. He is broken before a frozen god and he will never
find his way.

**Page 153-154:**
So. Here are the dead fathers. Their spirit is
entombed in the stone. It lies upon the land with the same weight
and the same ubiquity. For whoever makes a shelter of reeds and
hides has joined his spirit to the common destiny of creatures and
he will subside back into the primal mud with scarcely a cry. But
who builds in stone seeks to alter the structure of the universe
and so it was with these masons however primitive their works
may seem to us.

**Page 154:**
The way of the world is
to bloom and to flower and die but in the affairs of men there is
no waning and the noon of his expression signals the onset of
night. His spirit is exhausted at the peak of its achievement. His
meridian is at once his darkening and the evening of his day. He
loves games? Let him play for stakes. This you see here, these
ruins wondered at by tribes of savages, do you not think that this
will be again? Aye. And again. With other people, with other sons.

**Page 160:**
They rode on. They rode like men invested with a
purpose whose origins were antecedent to them, like blood
legatees of an order both imperative and remote. For although
each man among them was discrete unto himself, conjoined they
made a thing that had not been before and in that communal soul
were wastes hardly reckonable more than those whited regions on
old maps where monsters do live and where there is nothing
other of the known world save conjectural winds.

**Page 182:**
Like beings provoked out of the
absolute rock and set nameless and at no remove from their own
loomings to wander ravenous and doomed and mute as gorgons
shambling the brutal wastes of Gondwanaland in a time before
nomenclature was and each was all.

**Page 184:**
In the
days to come the frail black rebuses of blood in those sands would
crack and break and drift away so that in the circuit of few suns
all trace of the destruction of these people would be erased. The
desert wind would salt their ruins and there would be nothing, nor
ghost nor scribe, to tell to any pilgrim in his passing how it was
that people had lived in this place and in this place died.

**Page 209:**
Whatever exists, he said. Whatever in creation exists without
my knowledge exists without my consent.
He looked about at the dark forest in which they were
bivouacked. He nodded toward the specimens he'd collected.
These anonymous creatures, he said, may seem little or nothing
in the world. Yet the smallest crumb can devour us. Any smallest
thing beneath yon rock out of men's knowing. Only nature can
enslave man and only when the existence of each last entity is
routed out and made to stand naked before him will he be
properly suzerain of the earth.
What's a suzerain?
A keeper. A keeper or overlord.
Why not say keeper then?
Because he is a special kind of keeper. A suzerain rules even
where there are other rulers. His authority countermands local
judgements.
Toadvine spat.
The judge placed his hands on the ground. He looked at his
inquisitor. This is my claim, he said. And yet everywhere upon it
are pockets of autonomous life. Autonomous. In order for it to be
mine nothing must be permitted to occur upon it save by my
dispensation.
Toadvine sat with his boots crossed before the fire. No man
can acquaint himself with everthing on this earth, he said.

**Page 209-210:**
The man who believes that
the secrets of the world are forever hidden lives in mystery and
fear. Superstition will drag him down. The rain will erode the
deeds of his life. But that man who sets himself the task of
singling out the thread of order from the tapestry will by the
decision alone have taken charge of the world and it is only by
such taking charge that he will effect a way to dictate the terms
of his own fate.
I dont see what that has to do with catchin birds.
The freedom of birds is an insult to me. I'd have them all in
zoos.

Judge wants to become or he is GOD

**Page 241:**
The Apache wrenched
his pony's head around and when Glanton spun to look at his men
he found them frozen in deadlock with the savages, they and their
arms wired into a construction taut and fragile as those puzzles
wherein the placement of each piece is predicated upon every
other and they in turn so that none can move for bringing down
the structure entire.

**Page 256:**
That night
Glanton stared long into the embers of the fire. All about him his
men were sleeping but much was changed. So many gone,
defected or dead. The Delawares all slain. He watched the fire
and if he saw portents there it was much the same to him. He
would live to look upon the western sea and he was equal to
whatever might follow for he was complete at every hour.
Whether his history should run concomitant with men and
nations, whether it should cease. He'd long forsworn all weighing
of consequence and allowing as he did that men's destinies are
given yet he usurped to contain within him all that he would ever
be in the world and all that the world would be to him and be his
charter written in the urstone itself he claimed agency and said so
and he'd drive the remorseless sun on to its final endarkenment
as if he'd ordered it all ages since, before there were paths
anywhere, before there were men or suns to go upon them.

**Page 257-258:**
The flames sawed in the wind and the
embers paled and deepened and paled and deepened like the
bloodbeat of some living thing eviscerate upon the ground before
them and they watched the fire which does contain within it
something of men themselves inasmuch as they are less without
it and are divided from their origins and are exiles. For each fire is
all fires, the first fire and the last ever to be.

**Page 258-259:**
The question was then put as to whether there were on Mars
or other planets in the void men or creatures like them and at this
the judge who had returned to the fire and stood half naked and
sweating spoke and said that there were not and that there were
no men anywhere in the universe save those upon the earth. All
listened as he spoke, those who had turned to watch him and
those who would not.
The truth about the world, he said, is that anything is possible.
[…]
The universe is no narrow thing and the order within it is not
constrained by any latitude in its conception to repeat what exists
in one part in any other part. Even in this world more things exist
without our knowledge than with it and the order in creation
which you see is that which you have put there, like a string in a
maze, so that you shall not lose your way. For existence has its
own order and that no man's mind can compass, that mind itself
being but a fact among others.

**Page 259:**
The arc of circling bodies is determined by the length of their
tether, said the judge. Moons, coins, men.

**Page 261:**
In the neuter austerity of that terrain all
phenomena were bequeathed a strange equality and no one thing
nor spider nor stone nor blade of grass could put forth claim to
precedence. The very clarity of these articles belied their
familiarity, for the eye predicates the whole on some feature or
part and here was nothing more luminous than another and
nothing more enshadowed and in the optical democracy of such
landscapes all preference is made whimsical and a man and a
rock become endowed with unguessed kinships.

**Page 261:**
Even the judge grew silent and speculative. He'd
spoke of purging oneself of those things that lay claim to a man
but that body receiving his remarks counted themselves well done
with any claims at all.

**Page 261-262:**
The good book says that he that lives by the sword shall
perish by the sword, said the black.
The judge smiled, his face shining with grease. What right
man would have it any other way? he said.
The good book does indeed count war an evil, said Irving. Yet
there's many a bloody tale of war inside it.
It makes no difference what men think of war, said the judge.
War endures. As well ask men what they think of stone. War was
always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate
trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner. That is the way it was and
will be. That way and not some other way.

**Page 262-263:**
The judge smiled. Men are born for games. Nothing else.
Every child knows that play is nobler than work. He knows too
that the worth or merit of a game is not inherent in the game
itself but rather in the value of that which is put at hazard. Games
of chance require a wager to have meaning at all. Games of sport
involve the skill and strength of the opponents and the humiliation
of defeat and the pride of victory are in themselves sufficient
stake because they inhere in the worth of the principals and
define them. But trial of chance or trial of worth all games aspire
to the condition of war for here that which is wagered swallows
up game, player, all.
Suppose two men at cards with nothing to wager save their
lives. Who has not heard such a tale? A turn of the card. The
whole universe for such a player has labored clanking to this
moment which will tell if he is to die at that man's hand or that
man at his. What more certain validation of a man's worth could
there be? This enhancement of the game to its ultimate state
admits no argument concerning the notion of fate. The selection
of one man over another is a preference absolute and irrevocable
and it is a dull man indeed who could reckon so profound a
decision without agency or significance either one. In such games
as have for their stake the annihilation of the defeated the
decisions are quite clear. This man holding this particular
arrangement of cards in his hand is thereby removed from
existence. This is the nature of war, whose stake is at once the
game and the authority and the justification. Seen so, war is the
truest form of divination. It is the testing of one's will and the will
of another within that larger will which because it binds them is
therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war
is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god.

**Page 263-264:**
Moral law is an invention of mankind for the disenfranchise-
ment of the powerful in favor of the weak. Historical law subverts
it at every turn. A moral view can never be proven right or wrong
by any ultimate test. A man falling dead in a duel is not thought
thereby to be proven in error as to his views. His very involvement
in such a trial gives evidence of a new and broader view. The
willingness of the principals to forgo further argument as the
triviality which it in fact is and to petition directly the chambers of
the historical absolute clearly indicates of how little moment are
the opinions and of what great moment the divergences thereof.
For the argument is indeed trivial, but not so the separate wills
thereby made manifest. Man's vanity may well approach the
infinite in capacity but his knowledge remains imperfect and
howevermuch he comes to value his judgements ultimately he
must submit them before a higher court. Here there can be no
special pleading. Here are considerations of equity and rectitude
and moral right rendered void and without warrant and here are
the views of the litigants despised. Decisions of life and death, of
what shall be and what shall not, beggar all question of right. In
elections of these magnitudes are all lesser ones subsumed,
moral, spiritual, natural.
The judge searched out the circle for disputants. But what
says the priest? he said.
Tobin looked up. The priest does not say.
The priest does not say, said the judge. Nihil dicit. But the
priest has said. For the priest has put by the robes of his craft and
taken up the tools of that higher calling which all men honor. The
priest also would be no godserver but a god himself.
Tobin shook his head. You've a blasphemous tongue, Holden.
And in truth I was never a priest but only a novitiate to the order.
Journeyman priest or apprentice priest, said the judge. Men of
god and men of war have strange affinities.
I'll not secondsay you in your notions, said Tobin. Dont ask it.
Ah Priest, said the judge. What could I ask of you that you've
not already given?

**Page 266:**
Your heart's desire is to be told some mystery. The mystery is
that there is no mystery.

**Page 291:**
 All else was heaped on the flames and
while the sun rose and glistened on their gaudy faces they sat
upon the ground each with his new goods before him and they
watched the fire and smoked their pipes as might some painted
troupe of mimefolk recruiting themselves in such a wayplace far
from the towns and the rabble hooting at them across the
smoking footlamps, contemplating towns to come and the poor
fanfare of trumpet and drum and the rude boards upon which
their destinies were inscribed for these people were no less bound
and indentured and they watched like the prefigura-tion of their
own ends the carbonized skulls of their enemies incandescing
before them bright as blood among the coals.

**Page 299:**
Weigh your counsel, Priest, he said. We are all here together.
Yonder sun is like the eye of God and we will cook impartially
upon this great siliceous griddle I do assure you.
I'm no priest and I've no counsel, said Tobin. The lad is a free
agent. 

**Page 313:**
The lad spoke to him. He aint nothin. You told me so yourself.
Men are made of the dust of the earth. You said it was no pair...
pair...
Parable.
No parable. That it was a naked fact and the judge was a man
like all men.
Face him down then, said the expriest. Face him down if he is
so.

**Page 316:**
No assassin, called the judge. And no partisan either. There's a
flawed place in the fabric of your heart. Do you think I could not
know? You alone were mutinous. You alone reserved in your soul
some corner of clemency for the heathen.

**Page 317:**
They eked a desperate living from that land and
they knew that nothing excepting some savage pursuit could drive
men to such plight and they watched each day for that thing to
gather itself out of its terrible incubation in the house of the sun
and muster along the edge of the eastern world and whether it be
armies or plague or pestilence or something altogether
unspeakable they waited with a strange equanimity.

**Page 322:**
Told them the truth. That you were the person responsible.
Not that we have all the details. But they understand that it was
you and none other who shaped events along such a calamitous
course. Eventuating in the massacre at the ford by the savages
with whom you conspired. Means and ends are of little moment
here. Idle speculations. But even though you carry the draft of
your murderous plan with you to the grave it will nonetheless be
known in all its infamy to your Maker and as that is so so shall it
be made known to the least of men. All in the fullness of time.
You're the one that's crazy, said the kid.
The judge smiled. No, he said. It was never me.

**Page 323-324:**
He looked down the hallway. Dont be afraid, he said. I'll speak
softly. It's not for the world's ears but for yours only. Let me see
you. Dont you know that I'd have loved you like a son?
He reached through the bars. Come here, he said. Let me
touch you.
The kid stood with his back to the wall.
Come here if you're not afraid, whispered the judge.
I aint afraid of you.
The judge smiled. He spoke softly into the dim mud cubicle.
You came forward, he said, to take part in a work. But you were a
witness against yourself. You sat in judgement on your own
deeds. You put your own allowances before the judgements of
history and you broke with the body of which you were pledged a
part and poisoned it in all its enterprise. Hear me, man. I spoke in
the desert for you and you only and you turned a deaf ear to me.
If war is not holy man is nothing but antic clay. Even the cretin
acted in good faith according to his parts. For it was required of
no man to give more than he possessed nor was any man's share
compared to another's. Only each was called upon to empty out
his heart into the common and one did not. Can you tell me who
that one was?
It was you, whispered the kid. You were the one.
The judge watched him through the bars, he shook his head.
What joins men together, he said, is not the sharing of bread but
the sharing of enemies. But if I was your enemy with whom
would you have shared me? With whom? The priest? Where is he
now? Look at me. Our animosities were formed and waiting
before ever we two met. Yet even so you could have changed it
all.
You, said the kid. It was you.
It was never me, said the judge.

We ransacked the country. Six weeks.
Finally found a herd of eight animals and we killed them and
come in. They're gone. Ever one of them that God ever made is
gone as if they'd never been at all.
The ragged sparks blew down the wind. The prairie about
them lay silent. Beyond the fire it was cold and the night was
clear and the stars were falling. The old hunter pulled his blanket
about him. I wonder if there's other worlds like this, he said. Or if
this is the only one.

**Page 346-347:**
This is an orchestration for an event. For a
dance in fact. The participants will be apprised of their roles at the
proper time. For now it is enough that they have arrived. As the
dance is the thing with which we are concerned and contains
complete within itself its own arrangement and history and finale
there is no necessity that the dancers contain these things within
themselves as well. In any event the history of all is not the
history of each nor indeed the sum of those histories and none
here can finally comprehend the reason for his presence for he
has no way of knowing even in what the event consists. In fact,
were he to know he might well absent himself and you can see
that that cannot be any part of the plan if plan there be.

That feeling in the breast
that evokes a child's memory of loneliness such as when the
others have gone and only the game is left with its solitary
participant. A solitary game, without opponent. Where only the
rules are at hazard. Dont look away. We are not speaking in
mysteries. You of all men are no stranger to that feeling, the
emptiness and the despair. It is that which we take arms against,
is it not? Is not blood the tempering agent in the mortar which
bonds?

**Page 347:**
What do you think death is,
man? Of whom do we speak when we speak of a man who was
and is not? Are these blind riddles or are they not some part of
every man's jurisdiction? What is death if not an agency? And
whom does he intend toward?

**Page 348:**
That gods of vengeance and of compassion alike lie sleeping in
their crypt and whether our cries are for an accounting or for the
destruction of the ledgers altogether they must evoke only the
same silence and that it is this silence which will prevail? 

**Page 348:**
A man seeks his own destiny and no other, said the judge. Will
or nill. Any man who could discover Mis own fate and elect
therefore some opposite course could only come at last to that
selfsame reckoning at the same appointed time, for each man's
destiny is as large as the world he inhabits and contains within it
all opposites as well. This desert upon which so many have been
broken is vast and calls for largeness of heart but it is also
ultimately empty. It is hard, it is barren. Its very nature is stone.

**Page 348:**
Men's
memories are uncertain and the past that was differs little from
the past that was not.

**Page 349:**
I tell you this. As war becomes dishonored and its nobility
called into question those honorable men who recognize the
sanctity of blood will become excluded from the dance, which is
the warrior's right, and thereby will the dance become a false
dance and the dancers false dancers. And yet there will be one
there always who is a true dancer and can you guess who that
might be?
You aint nothin.
You speak truer than you know. But I will tell you. Only that
man who has offered up himself entire to the blood of war, who
has been to the floor of the pit and seen horror in the round and
learned at last that it speaks to his inmost heart, only that man
can dance.
Even a dumb animal can dance.
The judge set the bottle on the bar. Hear me, man, he said.
There is room on the stage for one beast and one alone. All
others are destined for a night that is eternal and without name.
One by one they will step down into the darkness before the
footlamps. Bears that dance, bears that dont.

On the plain
behind him are the wanderers in search of bones and those who
do not search and they move haltingly in the light like
mechanisms whose movements are monitored with escapement
and pallet so that they appear restrained by a prudence or
reflectiveness which has no inner reality and they cross in their
progress one by one that track of holes that runs to the rim of the
visible ground and which seems less the pursuit of some
continuance than the verification of a principle, a validation of
sequence and causality as if each round and perfect hole owed its
existence to the one before it there on that prairie upon which are
the bones and the gatherers of bones and those who do not
gather.
