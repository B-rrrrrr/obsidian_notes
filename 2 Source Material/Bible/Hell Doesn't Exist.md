“In the [Textus Receptus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textus_Receptus "en.m.wikipedia.org") version of the New Testament, on which the English [King James Version](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version "en.m.wikipedia.org") is based, the word "ᾅδης" (Hades), appears 11 times; but critical editions of the text of [1 Corinthians 15:55](http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=1%20Corinthians%2015%3A55%E2%80%9315%3A55&version=nrsv "bible.oremus.org") have "θάνατος" (death) in place of "ᾅδης". Except in this verse of 1 Corinthians, where it uses "grave", the King James Version translates "ᾅδης" as "hell". Modern translations, for which there are only 10 instances of the word "ᾅδης" in the New Testament, generally transliterate it as "Hades".

In all appearances but one, "ᾅδης" has little if any relation to [afterlife](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterlife "en.m.wikipedia.org") rewards or punishments. The one exception is Luke's parable of [Lazarus and the rich man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_and_Dives "en.m.wikipedia.org"), in which the rich man finds himself, after death, in Hades, and "in anguish in this flame", while in contrast the [angels](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel "en.m.wikipedia.org") take [Lazarus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_man_and_Lazarus "en.m.wikipedia.org") to "the [bosom of Abraham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosom_of_Abraham "en.m.wikipedia.org")", described as a state of comfort”.

So in the the bible the Greek word Hades can be translated as either hell or the grave, and is only described as a place of torment in a parable, which is a story taught to teach a lesson not a literal account. However the bible does mention Gehenna and the lake of fire, and describes them both in much the same way, so I will talk a little about what I read in my personal bible studies.

It is always good to read scriptures in context so that we allow the bible to explain itself. Many people believe that Revelation chapter 20 proves that there is a place of literal torment (it is after all called the lake of fire), but it has to be noted that the same lake of fire that the bible says that evil people , the devil and the demons would be thrown into, also has the grave thrown into it, how could the grave which is not even a real person be tormented? Rather than speculate about this, or listen to bible critics who would claim that this is a contradiction I think it is better to read what the bible actually says at Revelation chapter 20 and starting in verse number 12, it says:

“12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.

13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.

14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.

15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire”.

You can see that right after the resurrection of the dead both hell which can also be translated as the grave, and death are thrown into the lake of fire, and immediately thereafter the bible explains what the literal lake of fire is by saying “this is the second death.” If we keep reading into chapter 21 we find that the bible says in verse 4:

“And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away”.

So the end result of being thrown into the lake of fire for the grave is that God declares that it shall never exist again. If we combine our understanding of what the words meant in the original Greek with the reading of all scriptures in the context that they were written, I believe that instead of eternal torment the lake of fire and Gehenna describe eternal nonexistence. Thus the apostle Paul was correct when he said,

“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord”.

God does not give those who are unrepentantly wicked eternal life, not even in torment, he simply allows them to remain separate from Him in nonexistence for all eternity.
