## **Social Consequence 4: Weird, Hypersexual Media in a Sexless Society**

Sexual activity has declined wildly. I suspect it’s not at all controversial for me to say that sexual intimacy is a normal human need, and an element of a happy life.

Japan is a sexless nation.

> “Japan has the lowest sexual frequency in the world, and it is the only country where the percentage of people who are not happy with their sex life is higher than that of those who are.”[17](https://substack.com/home/post/p-181204292#footnote-17-181204292)

In the quoted survey, sexlessness is defined by having sex less than once a month. 19% of partnered individuals in their 30s surveyed described being sexless by this definition. Nearly half of all Japanese millennials (18-34) were virgins in 2016.[18](https://substack.com/home/post/p-181204292#footnote-18-181204292)

_Call me a harlot_, but I see sex as being a normative prosocial behavior. If individuals are interested in sex, but unable to obtain it, it typically indicates a major social deficit. Normal relational and life milestones are being missed. Nearly 1 in 3 American men reported no sexual activity in 2020.[19](https://substack.com/home/post/p-181204292#footnote-19-181204292) Gen Z is afraid to have sex.[20](https://substack.com/home/post/p-181204292#footnote-20-181204292) 24% of Americans 18-29 report having no sex in a year.[21](https://substack.com/home/post/p-181204292#footnote-21-181204292)

Dating requires a few factors to happen: disposable income, a stable schedule, and housing privacy. Late stage conditions produce irregular work hours, high costs of living relative to wages, and people living with their parents or roommates into mid-life. Relationships, or even casual sex, become logistical drains.

Parasociality becomes a pressure valve for unmet intimacy needs.

Idols function as emotional surrogates in a society where adult intimacy is not just difficult to achieve, but structurally inaccessible. These cute, frill adorned women are not like the American popstars meant to appeal to a young female fanbase. Rather, their groupies are older men who entrench themselves in a parasocial obsession with the young, often minor performers.[22](https://substack.com/home/post/p-181204292#footnote-22-181204292)

The “no-dating” rule that these groups and their labels enforce are meant to maintain the illusion of availability and sexual purity to lonely men.

Parasociality emerges because real relationships require stability and time investment — neither accessible to the average Japanese worker.

Traditionally, celebrities existed behind a barrier. Fan engagement was limited to managed press releases, magazine interviews, and staged performances. There was a finite flow of personal information to the public. Idol culture breaks that boundary, and frankly American influencer culture does too.

Fans now access ongoing, unfiltered streams of personal content where the celebrity is necessarily a fictitious character in everyday life. Idol systems monetize emotional deprivation — handshake events, loyalty expenditures, and micro-intimacy displays as merchandise. Influencers replicate this through daily vlogging, livestream Q&As, DM responses, Cameo-style personalized videos, and Patreon subscriber tiers. Hell, in the US you can even sometimes purchase the sex of your favorite influencers via their Onlyfans accounts. Intimacy is entirely transactional and the entire human — from body, mind, and ordinary life — become consumer products.

Just like how idol fans enforce when idols can date, marry, break up, or have intimate relations, influencers experience just the same with subscriber drop-off or harassment after announcing a relationship. The idol is not admired for their art; their personhood is the product and that same economy has been laundered to the US in a different form.
