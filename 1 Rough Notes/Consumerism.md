Graffiti on a white wall went viral last year. Black and red spray paint, six words: “Endless growth is the strategy of cancer cells.”

That’s not economics. That’s biology. Growth that cannot stop. That consumes everything around it. That treats its host as a resource to be depleted.

We call it the economy. We’re told we owe it our loyalty.

But we’re not cells. We can choose. We’ve chosen before.
