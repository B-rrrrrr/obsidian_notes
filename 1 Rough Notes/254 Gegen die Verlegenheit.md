### What Nietzsche Means by “Embarrassment”

By _embarrassment_ (Verlegenheit), Nietzsche is not mainly talking about social awkwardness. He means:

- self-consciousness
    
- inward hesitation
    
- being caught looking at oneself
    
- the uncomfortable feeling of _standing exposed before oneself or others_
    

Embarrassment arises when the self becomes an object of scrutiny.

### “He who is always thoroughly occupied…”

Nietzsche is saying that **deep, total engagement** with something _outside oneself_ dissolves this self-consciousness.

If you are:

- fully absorbed in work, creation, thinking, danger, or responsibility
    
- compelled by a task that demands your whole attention
    

then there is **no surplus attention left over** to watch yourself, judge yourself, or feel awkward about yourself.

So embarrassment disappears not because you are morally better, but because **the ego has no idle time to fold back on itself**.

### Is It About “Becoming Better”?

Not primarily.

Nietzsche is not praising busyness as self-improvement or moral growth. He often mocks _busywork_ and shallow productivity. What he means is:

- occupation that **overpowers the self**
    
- a task that is _larger than one’s vanity_
    

It could be:

- artistic creation
    
- philosophical thinking
    
- warfare
    
- scientific investigation
    
- genuine passion
    

What matters is intensity, not improvement.

### Constant Change vs. Self-Fixation

You are right, though, about **becoming** rather than **being**.

Embarrassment thrives when one:

- freezes oneself into an identity
    
- asks, “How do I appear?”
    
- worries about coherence or reputation
    

A person in constant motion—_becoming_ rather than posing—has nothing to defend, explain, or justify.

But Nietzsche’s emphasis is not “I am getting better,” rather:

> “I am not looking at myself at all.”

### More Nietzschean Formulation

A more precise restatement would be:

> Those who are completely seized by a task no longer experience embarrassment because they are no longer spectators of themselves.

This aligns with Nietzsche’s broader suspicion of **self-reflection as a symptom of weakness or decadence** when it becomes excessive.

### In Short

Nietzsche is **not** saying:

- busy people are morally superior
    
- constant improvement eliminates embarrassment
    

He **is** saying:

- embarrassment is a byproduct of idle self-awareness
    
- total engagement annihilates the conditions under which embarrassment arises
    

If you want, I can connect this aphorism to:

- Nietzsche’s critique of modern “inner life”
    
- his praise of artists and warriors
    
- or his idea of _forgetting_ as a strength
