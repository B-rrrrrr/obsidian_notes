”Yet again, an excellent piece. First, I want you to know just how much I value your work and how frequently I use it in my own teachings, presentations, supervision, and counseling sessions. Thank you.

My opinion is that causality can also be ascribed to the sharp, yet not novel, rise in postmodern deconstructionism being taught across colleges and universities. Those students have younger siblings, and the graduates of those insitutions across the past 12-15 years (when it really exploded) have found jobs in K-12 education and corporate America, influencing yet more young minds.

When young people are taught that literally nothing is real, everything is merely a construct of a construct built by oneself (or others), and that well anchored ideas and beliefs are not merely uncommon but in some cases harmful or hateful, that leaves them disillusioned and unpassionate, verging on nihilism. They have no mooring from which to view the world, no stable sense of identity from which to form opinions. Their lens is constantly refracting based on what they think others expect of them, which itself is constantly changing.

Life has become a house of mirrors for this generation, and because they have no anchor point, they have no place from which to assert themselves, take a stand, and stop reflexively reacting to the latest stimulus. As such, this current generation has gone adrift in its own echo chamber of self-inflicted lethargy. And because it has been taught only to tear down and reject - never to build - any efforts to realign based on reason or truth are wholly rebuffed, thus perpetuating the feedback loop of disconnection and misery.

This is why your work, along with Jonathan Haidt, Zach Rausch, Lenore Skenazy, Bari Weiss, Jordan Peterson, and many others is so, so important. It offers a path out of this psychological dystopia. Keep it up please, we need you!”
