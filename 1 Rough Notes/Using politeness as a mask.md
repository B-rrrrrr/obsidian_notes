Such a person sees each person or event as something that is there to damage them
- **Unsure about one’s own position and fearing the worst:**  
    The polite person is fundamentally insecure. They anticipate danger or harm in every situation because they lack confidence in their own strength or judgment.
    
- **Create a mask that appeals to everyone and treats them well:**  
    Politeness and charm are **defensive strategies**. By appearing agreeable and inoffensive, the person hopes to avoid conflict or negative consequences. Their kindness is **instrumental**, not authentic.
    
- **Sees each person or event as something that is there to damage them:**  
    This person interprets the world through the lens of fear. Every interaction is a potential threat, so behavior is reactive rather than proactive. Their sociality is shaped by self-preservation rather than genuine engagement with life.
