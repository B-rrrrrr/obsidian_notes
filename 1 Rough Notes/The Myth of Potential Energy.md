## The Myth of Potential Energy

I suspect we all know people (including sometimes ourselves) who fall into the trap of planning without doing. The person who plans to get in shape, asks for advice on which exercises to do and which protein shakes to drink, but never **does** consistent exercise. I’m not talking about procrastinators who do no work at all, but people who substitute preparation for progress.

Something I see a lot in people who claim they want to make games — but who aren’t actually making them — is the idea that they can build up potential energy that will eventually transform into kinetic energy. Instead of working on their game they read game design books, which gives them greater game design insights, so when they **do** work on the game it will be that much better! Instead of messing around in Blender they watch Youtube videos on how to use Blender.

Consuming these things is fine, if you’re watching on your phone on the bus or during your lunch break. But for many people consuming this content is worse than doing nothing, since it tricks their brain into thinking they’re making progress. Food that fills them up but has no nutritional value.

Prolonged prototyping often rests on the idea that you’re building up potential energy. That you’re “laying the groundwork” and “answering outstanding questions”, so that when you begin work “for real” you’ll hit the ground running.

In reality you might stumble out the blocks when you realize the separate features you prototyped don’t play together nicely. That the game had “30 seconds of fun” in prototype form but each 30 seconds is the same as every other, so while it’s fun for 30 seconds it’s not fun for 30 hours. There are plenty of issues that only rear their head during production, even when a vertical slice is supposed to guard against that.

Laying the groundworks is important, but sometimes that we’re laying the groundwork is a white lie we tell ourselves.
