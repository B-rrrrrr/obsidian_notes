12 By suppressing the ability to suffer, the ability to be happy and is also suppressed. 
14 Love between the two genders is an inherently selfish act, with a desire from the one to be the highest desire of the other. Only the love from friendship is an act of true love that builds itself off of the other’s uniqueness.
14 If we stop transcending ourselves and our inner limits, we will become tired of ourselves, for we will have possessed ourselves without desire for too long.
28 Witnessing or having strength can both build a person up, but also bring a person down, through self-destruction, which will either be reparable or irreparable.
54 Because reality is filtered through our perception of it, meaning and value arise from our interpretations of reality. Life becomes worthwhile, not because it inherently is, but because we choose to see it as such.
56 By cowardly projecting suffering onto others and the outside, the self becomes not responsible for it; despair is the result. Only by dealing with pain from within, can suffering be life-affirming.
58 Appearances gradually shape what seems real, and meaning is derived from these appearances. However, they can only change through the power of creation and transformation.
68 We create images that everyone needs to mould themselves by. If a group is seen as negative, though, it is not the group that needs to change for the better, but the image and therefore the creators of the image.
86 Art consumed for comfort and escape only want to have an illusion of transformation without the demanding effort required for it.
87 Vanity can attract admiration and appreciation from others, but vanity prevents true discovery of oneself.
107 Seeing reality honestly will drive a person to despair, and it is through art that this reality can be reinterpreted and seen as a life-affirming drive to self-improvement.
116 Morality is acting with the thoughts and ideas of others, even when they are not there, which limits the creation of own ideas. 
117 Morality is acting with the thoughts and ideas of others, even when they are not there, which limits the creation of own ideas. 
119 Being selfless in the way that one becomes used by another, eliminates the art of creating and forces such a person to adhere to others to find meaning and use in existence.
124 Once one abandons traditional values and creates their own, they cannot return to their original knowledge and must through hardship keep going on their journey through the unknown.
125 Without the outside forces of a God, everything becomes meaningless. To transcend this, one must create their own values and meaning to not succumb to despair.
127 Will is not a magical force that changes us, but the result from the self to a culmination of suffering.
135 If God is dead, then transgression should not shame us any more.
151 Without the outside forces of a God, everything becomes meaningless. To transcend this, one must create their own values and meaning to not succumb to despair.
154 Fulfilment leads to greater joy and greater despair
164 Our surroundings brutally reveal how honest we are about our aims.
165 Voluntarily disengaging with the things that bring us comfort will reawaken the joy of the first discovery of them when reuniting.
166 Through only listenting to and surrounding ourselves with those who bring us comfort, we only interact with similarities of us, therefore losing the need to improve ourselves. 
173 Things that cannot be comprehended may appear to have depth and be profound, but they may be masking their actuality and abuse self-doubt.
179 We should learn to accept the fact that we are made up of many different parts that cannot be explained with one simple fact or by simply thinking about ourselves.
186 Feeling guilt for conforming to society and feeling guilt for not conforming to inner values; the former is the least important.
190 Through only listenting to and surrounding ourselves with those who bring us comfort, we only interact with similarities of us, therefore losing the need to improve ourselves.

210 Trying to be better than others creates a sense of anxiety and will eventually lead to despair, whereas striving for own goals creates leads to overcoming personal limits and finding true happiness within that.
214 Feeling accomplished for one’s actions does not come from the action itself, but the belief within the action.
215 Therefore, when forming one’s own ideal, one must learn one’s own nature and understand one’s deepest drives in order to create an idea that corresponds to that nature. 
227 A person who cannot govern themselves, cannot be governed by others and makes those who try slaves to the others.
228 Those who merely take ideas and do not disagree, challenge, or change them are weak-minded individuals who merely borrow thoughts, letting hypocrisy and selflessness dictate their lives.
229 Once a habit is formed and discipline followed, seeing the bad within that habit is difficult. Instead, one keeps following old guidelines out of a sense of hypocrisy to oneself, inertia, pride, or clinging on to old things.
235 A balance between these two characteristics is required to reach high, and remain high.
