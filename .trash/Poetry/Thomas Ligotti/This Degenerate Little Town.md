## This Degenerate Little Town by Thomas Ligotti

> The greatest secret  
> Which appears in no religious doctrine  
> And is found nowhere  
>   
> In the world's overburdened library  
> Of myths and fables  
> Nor receives the slightest mention  
> In any philosopher's system  
> Or scientist's speculation  
> The greatest secret  
> Perhaps the only secret  
> Is that the universe  
> All of creation  
> Owes its existence  
> To a degenerate little town  
> And if it were possible  
> To strip away the scenery that surrounds us  
> To pull up the landscape  
> Of every planet  
> To rip away the skies  
> And shove aside the stars and suns  
> To tear from ourselves our own flesh  
> And delve deep into our bones  
> We would find it standing there eternal  
> The origin of all things visible  
> Or invisible  
> The source of everything that is  
> Or can be  
> This degenerate little town  
> And then we would discover  
> Its twisted streets  
> And tilting houses  
> Its decaying ground  
> And rotting sky  
> And with our own eyes  
> We would see the diseased faces  
> Peeking from grimy windows  
> Then we would realize  
> Why it is such a secret  
> The greatest and most vile secret  
> This degenerate little town  
> Where everything began  
> And from whose core of corruption  
> Everything seeps out  
>   
> From the beginning  
> If there was a beginning  
> This degenerate little town  
> Has become ever more degenerate;  
> Its streets more twisted  
> Its houses more tilting  
> Its ground more decayed  
> Its sky more rotten  
> Those faces behind ever more grimy windows  
> Have become ever more diseased  
> And in the end  
> But there can never be an end  
> For this degenerate little town  
> No more than an end will ever come  
> For the worlds that have seeped out of it  
> For everything we can know  
> Is degenerate from the beginning  
> Everything becomes more twisted and tilting  
> More diseased and decayed  
> Rotting from the very sky  
> This is the law of things  
> If there can be any law  
> In a universe that has its source and origin  
> In a degenerate little town  
> Which has been degenerate from the beginning  
> If there was a beginning  
> And will go on with its degeneration  
> Its ceaseless twisting and tilting  
> Its disease and decay  
> Its infinite shades of rottenness  
>   
> Forever and without end  
>   
> We cannot help but wonder  
> In our most perverse moments  
> What it would be like  
> To inhabit this degenerate little town  
> Where the sky is forever dripping its rottenness like rain  
> To be among those faces  
> That are diseased faces  
> Eternally diseased faces  
> Eternally peeking through the glass of grimy windows  
> And out into twisted streets  
> Lined with tilting houses  
> In a town that is forever degenerating  
> And will be degenerating forever  
> We cannot help but wonder  
> In our most perverse moments  
> As we look through bleary eyes  
> And see the stars that seem to form  
> So many twisting roads through the blackness  
> Or feel our flesh rotting upon our bones  
> And yet we can only wonder  
>   
> We can only whisper  
>   
> Or cry out in our dreams  
> "O, where is the way to this degenerate little town?"  
>   
> There are those among us  
> Who claim to have seen  
> This degenerate little town  
> Although they may be unaware  
> Of its true nature  
> There are those who have emerged  
> From some painful ordeal of the body  
> Or of the mind  
> And then begun speaking  
> Of how they saw in the distance  
> An outline of crooked houses  
> Tilting this way and that  
> Or walked along some twisted street  
> And felt the ground soft with decay  
> Beneath their steps  
> Or even glimpsed those diseased faces  
> Their skin rough and pale as plaster  
> Peeking from behind grimy windows  
> But those who claim to have seen such things  
> Always seem to tell a somewhat different story  
> Failing to compose a consistent picture  
> Of what they may have seen  
> Or imagine they have seen  
> And so we stare at them suspiciously  
>   
> For a moment  
> And then start to walk away  
>   
> Leaving them to their lies or their illusions  
> Which of course are the very essence  
> Of this degenerate little town  
>   
> "Where is this place?  
> This degenerate little town?  
> What is its name?  
> And who were its creators?"  
> Such questions are inevitable  
> And a matter of course  
> Whenever a world knowledge  
> Is attained about anything  
> Never mind the greatest secret  
> The greatest mystery  
> "Are there seasons in the land of this town?  
> Is there a springtime in which great rains  
> Pour down day and night from that rotting sky?  
> Are there sultry summers that lay a  
> Heavy stillness upon those twisted streets?  
> And what of its autumn  
> Which must be so succulent with all the colours of decay?  
> Do the winters there, in this degenerate little town  
> Pile their weighty snows upon the roofs of those tilting houses?"  
> So many question about this secret place  
> But as long as such questions are asked  
>   
> And countless answers are offered  
> The greatest secret will always remain protected  
> For no questions will ever be asked  
>   
> No answers will ever be allowed  
> Concerning those diseased faces  
> That have gazed forever  
> Behind the glass of grimy windows  
>   
> Like every phenomenon  
> That we cannot fully face  
> This degenerate little town  
> Must remain a cult in its essence  
> And serve as a limit  
> For such as we care to know  
> About what is beyond  
> The blackness of night  
> Or what is deep in our bones  
> For like every phenomenon  
> That we have actually come to face  
> This degenerate little town  
> Can only pain us  
> Adding to our lives  
> A mere surplus of the pains  
> We have known so well  
> Throughout the agonised ages  
> Of a degenerate creation  
> But like no other phenomenon  
> That we have ever faced  
> This degenerate little town  
> Under its rotting sky  
> Standing upon decayed ground  
> A landscape of a pain  
> That is like no other  
>   
> May be our last hope  
> The only hope we have  
> Of killing all the hopes  
> We have ever had  
>   
> And murdering every mystery  
> We have ever cherished  
> So that we may step forth, finally  
> Into that great shining kingdom  
> Of which we have always dreamed  
>   
> It may be quite likely  
> That we are grotesquely mistaken  
> To think there is anything special  
> Anything remarkable at all  
> About this degenerate little town  
> Far from being the greatest secret  
> The worst or the finest of all our dreams  
> It may be quite likely  
> The greatest commonplace  
> The supreme banality  
> Consider the possibility  
> Who among us  
> Has not found themself  
> Beneath a rotting sky?  
> A sky broken and rotting  
> From what has been heaved up to it  
> During every epic of this earth  
> This ground that is miles deep  
> With the decay of anything  
> That has ever lived upon it  
> Who has not traveled  
> Through twisted streets  
> And under the shadow of houses  
> Even the straightest of which  
> If our eyes could only see it  
> Is veering toward a tilt?  
> As for diseased faces  
> They are ever-prevailing  
>   
> To the point of embarrassment  
> And so much for this civic marvel  
> That is beyond the blackness of night  
> Or resides deep in our bones  
> Yet if this is the case  
>   
> As it quite likely may be  
> What remains for us in a universe  
> Where there is nothing special  
> Nothing of any account  
> Let alone the saving miracle  
> Of this degenerate little town?  
>   
> It seems entirely natural that  
> Should anyone gain full knowledge  
> Of this degenerate little town  
> They would deny the truth  
> Of this greatest, most terrible of secrets  
> And, as a consequence  
> As an act of self-protection  
> Would fabricate some other  
> Set of circumstances  
> A more companionable picture  
> Of the way of things  
> This would explain so many  
> Of the deranged idols and beliefs  
> That have arisen in our world  
> At least we would be able to account  
> For the multitudes of Mannequin Saviors  
> As one might view them  
> Their faces smooth and serene  
> Behind display windows  
> Welcoming the faithful who  
> Upon their death  
> Will enter a department-store paradise  
> Of the most vague and intangible delights  
> And some mention must be made  
> Of what might be called  
> The Sect of the Puppetlands  
> Whose highly deranged adherents  
> Posit a transcendent universe  
> Of infinite and harmless antics  
> That are imperfectly mirrored  
> In the chaos and crises of our own world  
> Which, in any case, will end nicely  
>   
> When the Great Puppet Play is concluded  
> In a sweet bedtime of slumber  
> Until the next show begins  
> Yet, who would begrudge anyone  
> The denials or alternate renderings  
> Of the twisted streets and tilting houses  
>   
> The diseased faces and grimy windows of  
> This degenerate little town  
> Which itself seems so perfectly bleak  
> So in tune with the world we know  
> Forever inclined to ever greater degeneracy  
> That even the few enlightened ones among us  
> Sometimes doubt it to be real  
>   
> We sometimes imagine  
> That we have heard voices  
> Strange and harsh voices  
> Faintly calling from beyond  
> The blackness of night  
> Or from deep in our bones  
> And even if there are no actual words  
> No actual language we know  
> In which the voices speak  
> Still there is a terrible understanding  
> Delivered into our world  
> That only a few may comprehend  
> And none would desire  
> For this understanding  
> This message of strange harsh voices  
> From beyond the blackness of night  
> Or from deep in our bones  
> Declares that this degenerate little town  
> That greatest of secrets  
> Is only a facade  
> Or a mirage  
> A picturesque lie  
> Or illusion  
> In the guise of twisted streets and tilting houses  
>   
> All the rottenness and disease which we sense  
> As the source of all the things we know  
> Or can ever know  
> When in fact there is something else altogether  
> Something which none could comprehend  
> Or desire to comprehend  
> Yet which they cannot fail to hear  
>   
> When it slips through the sounds  
> Of those strange and harsh voices  
> When it drifts through  
> During the briefest moments of silence  
> And from beyond the blackness of night  
> Or from deep in our bones  
> Comes forth as the hollow resonance  
> Of a most dismal laughter  
>   
> Even though there is no evidence  
> That a degenerate little town  
> Forms the greatest secret  
> And is the source  
> Of all the things we know  
> Its truth and its existence remain assured  
> And there do seem to be certain indications  
> Certain aspects and elements of our lives  
> That in no uncertain terms  
> Inform us of one fact  
> Sooner or later we will find ourselves  
> In this degenerate little town  
> Whether we wish to go there or not  
> Because when the sky  
> Begins to darken  
> As if rotting before our eyes  
> And when our bones  
> Begin to change  
> Growing soft with decay  
> We know that all the ways  
> Of our lives  
> Have been leading us  
> And can only lead us  
> To this degenerate little town  
> And then we may understand  
> That everything around us..
