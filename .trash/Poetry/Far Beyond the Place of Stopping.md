## Far Beyond the Place of Stopping by R. J. Williamson

> I journeyed, long in walking, far beyond the place of stopping  
> Where there was no more returning to the people I had known.  
> I saw the world forgotten, where the grass gives up on growing  
> And I knew that I would never make another journey home.
> 
> Upon that fleshy plain, below the final rock outcropping  
> Stretched the vast and empty desert of the hungry, bleeding thing  
> Encompassing the earth to the horizon, all-consuming,  
> Crying in a thousand voices to its desolate god-king.
> 
> And the music of its crying, never dead, ever dying,  
> Sent me running in a madness I can scarce compare to fear,  
> Not to safety, but to silence - unto my own unmaking.  
> And yet now, upon awaking, once again the song I hear.
> 
> I long to taste the fruit of earth, I long for water quenching  
> Of my thirst, unending, nothing that remains can satisfy.  
> For my voice has joined the chorus ever more, ever mourning.  
> Ever singing, ever hungry. Ever dying, never die.
