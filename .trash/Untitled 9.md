# We want to be with ourselves
Throughout time but especially through the invention of the internet have we always tried to search for those who are like us. We love those people who give us praise and validation. In fact, we like this so much, that critiques seem harmful to us, and so we avoid them. By doing this, we only hear things that we ourselves know, and therefore lack the sight to see our weaknesses and then lack the will for self-improvement. 

We like to be praised and validated, and like people who give these feelings to us. Therefore, we surround ourselves with those who comfort us and also in turn exclude those who challenge us. In excluding the others, we try to disprove them by instead focusing on the things said by those who comfort us, or we take their words not as truth but as insignificant nonsense that can be forgotten about. Even when with other people, we remain only with ourselves and lack a foundation of self-discovery from others seeing the weaknesses within us.

By doing this, we create an environment that consists of only comfort. We establish a fabricated society that only further deepens our self-worth and doesn’t challenge us in any way. Our self-equilibrium bases itself upon this foundation, and those who seek to differ from us end up shaking it, thus pushing ourselves even further away from those others. We become vulnerable by trying to seek stability. Despite thinking we are open-minded, we become extremely closed off from others.

As a result of this, we learn less about the world. Our horizons remain limited, and we are unable to grow as a person, for growth originates from discomfort, and we can only expand our minds through taking in new ideas, especially those that show our weaknesses. 

Through only listening to and surrounding ourselves with those who bring us comfort, we only interact with similarities of us, therefore losing the need to improve ourselves.
