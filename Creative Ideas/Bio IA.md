Enzyme activity and survival under stressors like heavy metals and whether it can be prevented or slowed down through changing the graphs or stuff like temperature and oxygen level etc.

How does parisite host targeting affect their survival rate? (generalist vs specialist for example)

Parasite host manipulation (rodents become not scared of cats → picking prey so that it can infect a larger predator for example)

In extreme conditions does removing a trait of a person let them survive better in that environment (removing the need for oxygen i guess Player adapts to survive extreme environments but at a cost to human traits)
