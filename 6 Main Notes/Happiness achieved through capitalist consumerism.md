# Happiness achieved through capitalist consumerism
Isn’t it strange how we constantly say that money doesn’t buy happiness, and yet we still follow this, or rather, advertisements lead us to that belief. And consumption in general makes us quite content with life, even being optimized to infuse our brains with as much dopamine as possible. Thus, we’ve made happiness achievable through capitalist and consumerist thinking, which has lead to dystopian consequences for us.

Happiness is something that needs to be achieved to disrupt change. Happiness is our goal in life and once we’ve achieved happiness, we don’t want to move away from it. This state of being is something that higher ups want to abuse, and so they create ways of achieving happiness through “unpersonal” ways. 

One such way is through consumerism. Once we have this, we will be happy. With this thing, others will like me and I will be happy because of that. Thus, we’ve become a consumerist society, constantly consuming and buying to find this happiness that ends up making us content with a situation that doesn’t benefit us or bring true fulfilment. We just become animals, searching for the next thing to buy to be happy and to be tamed by those higher up.

Making happiness achievable through consumption and capitalism creates animals that become tame once they consume or buy things told to make them happy.
