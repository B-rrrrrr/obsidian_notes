# Happiness through suffering
Give a rich man a hundred dollars, and he won’t care. Give a hundred dollars to a homeless man, and he’s the happiest person in the world. But why is this the case?

It all bases itself on balance and how a person experiences emotions. In other words, what their baseline is. In this case, in order to feel happy the rich man requires more money than the poor man, because their baselines are wildly different. 

Removing the money from the equation and focusing entirely on happiness however won’t work as well. How can a person become happier if they “get” more happiness? How does a person “get” happiness? For this to work the baseline has to be changed. If a person is constantly happy, they will get used to the amount and thus that will become their baseline. Thus trying to experience a similar amount of happiness will require a significant amount more and simply, it is not something that can be achieved.

Instead of trying to “get” happier, exposing oneself to the opposite, in this case suffering, will paradoxically make a person happier. Through suffering, the baseline that a person has will be lowered and thus make it easier, or even possible, to experience a similar amount of happiness. Except in this world, exposure to suffering is strongly disapproved of. Why would a person willingly put themselves in discomfort and pain? It should be avoided at all costs. But instead by avoiding suffering, one also avoids happiness.

By suppressing the ability to suffer, the ability to be happy and is also suppressed.
