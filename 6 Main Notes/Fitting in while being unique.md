# Fitting in while being unique
In society, we want to fit in, but we still want to feel different to others. So how is this possible?

In order to fit in, we need to act like the others. By doing this, we become not what we ourselves are, but what others are. Stereotypes, in other words. We tend to do this when we are young and in our teenage years, since we don’t know what we want to be. Afterwards, we then want to become something more diverse and separate from others. But, by overdoing this, we distance ourselves too much. We become lonely and are unable to find support from others. We become an outsider of society. 

Instead, to prevent this, we can act like we are diverse. We engage in strange things within societal norms, stuff like metal or punk music, modern art, etc. These do differ from societal norms, but make a person unique. However, they still are a part of a group of people. They don’t go too far from the norms of the respective group, they just act like they are a unique individual while still conforming to societal norms.

To not be lonely and to find comfort with others while still being a unique individual, one must act like they have their own beliefs while in actuality they are still conforming to societal standards.
