# Work for others or for oneself?
Doing work that benefits others should be fulfilling, no? People have basic needs and requirements that need to be realized, and by being the person to do this, one has a sense of doing good in the world, doing things that need to be done. Therefore, one should look at such a condition with pride, since work is being done, that others would find draining, boring, or pitiful.

But at the same time, doing work that has oneself written into it feels better to do. It feels like one is actually a human, thinking and doing for themselves. This is what true self-fulfilment feels like; actually fulfilling. Maybe the work isn’t really that important in the long run and doesn’t help others, but it definitely helps oneself.

However, stopping the work that others need, whether that be in order to pursue own, more meaningful goals, or to stop oneself from becoming overwhelmed by the boredom, suffering and torture of the other work, it is seen as bad. One is rebelling against the norms, and society condemns it. Loneliness follows and one has to truly ask oneself if this is what should be done.

Society prioritizes doing work that benefits others, but by doing own work, one goes against this system, isolating oneself from others.
