# Using suffering
Throughout life, we all experience a kind of suffering within ourselves. Boredom, displeasure, and dissatisfaction with oneself are all very common forms of this, and they cause a desire for action. This suffering cannot be escaped from, and eventually this desire will grow so strong that it must be acted upon. This can occur in two ways: via transformation of the self, or via a projection onto the world.

When projected onto the outside world, suffering loses its root in the self. The world turns into a cruel place to live in and others are the cause for all wrongdoing, not ourselves. Instead of dealing with the suffering from within, its root is fantasized to be from the outside, therefore eliminating any action to actually transform self by suffering. There is no joy to be found in such a way of life, only despair from the unrelenting pain.

However, by making the realization that suffering comes from within and therefore must be dealt with by oneself and not anyone else, suffering can become life-affirming. The desire can in this case be acted upon, and the self slowly transformed and improved to let suffering be a guide rather than a demagogue. 

By cowardly projecting suffering onto others and the outside, the self becomes not responsible for it; despair is the result. Only by dealing with pain from within, can suffering be life-affirming.
