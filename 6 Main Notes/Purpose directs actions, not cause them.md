# Purpose directs actions, not cause them
A match is struck and then is put into a barrel of gunpowder, which then explodes. Despite everyone realizing that the barrel is the actual action itself and not the match, we still believe that the match was the actual thing that caused the action. Why?

When we want to find the will and the power to do actions, we make goals for ourselves or derive purposes to follow. It is with this motivation that we can move forward in our lives and derive meaning from life. Without a goal or a purpose in an action, the action itself seems almost pointless and meaningless. Purposes and goals are the match.

However, there lies a force within us all that is just waiting to be used up. It provides us with the energy and power needed to do something. This force brings us closer to the things we want to accomplish. It is the barrel of gunpowder.

Despite this clear difference, we still believe that what causes our actions is not the inherent force that we have within us, but rather the goals and purposes. We believe the match has more power over the barrel of gunpowder.  It therefore goes to show, that purpose is not an inherent part of human nature, but a mere interpretation after the fact. Our purposes are not predetermined or necessary to live, the force remains within us.

Purposes and goals are not what drives us to action, rather it directs our action.
