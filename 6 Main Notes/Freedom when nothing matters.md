# Freedom when nothing matters
Man lives his life with goals. He follows them and is led by them to the things that matter in life. It is what gets him up in the morning, what keeps him alive, from committing suicide. He believes he is truly free in this case, since all values are created by him. But, what happens when one realizes that nothing truly matters any more. When all goals in life are completely worthless to everyone and even oneself. Wouldn’t death be the only realistic thing that makes sense in such a case? Or is it possible to live a life when one has no appeal towards anything?

First, in order to live a life without appeal, one must not bring meaning or greater meaning towards anything. This includes not committing suicide, since suicide is the acceptance of the limit of life and resolves the uncertainty of the meaning of life. Instead, life must be lived as life comes to one, without giving it any meaning. 

When living life without any goals, though, how can one live a fulfilling life that is worth living. Isn’t it better to at least have some goal that advances oneself further, than just living life and doing nothing worthwhile with oneself? 

By attaching a goal to oneself, one makes oneself conform to that goal. This is not freedom. One is not truly free when one has to constantly attach oneself to the previous beliefs that one had. By living in the present moment, not worrying about tomorrow since who knows if one is even going to be alive then, one can be truly free and work on the things that one actually finds passion within. By living like there is no tomorrow in a way, one lives perhaps not more fully, but more passionately, with things that matter to oneself right this instant, not that could matter eventually.

Living in the present moment without attaching any goals to life makes one free and lets one live more passionately, focusing on the things that truly matter to oneself.
