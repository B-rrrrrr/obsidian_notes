# True help comes from seeking it out
Isn’t it strange how self-help books seem to help no one? They all talk about the same content, and yet none of it helps anyone. The reason for this, is precisely because it is too obvious. No shit it’s good to have good hygiene, but how do I fix a problem that plagues me immensely? Instead, one must turn to advice that isn’t handed out, but sought out.

As we currently do, we love to preach about the things we love and that have helped us. We tell everyone all the things that gave us support in hopes of giving them support. Or if we think something should get more attention and appreciation, we spread the word. Except, by doing this, it slowly turns from a special and helpful thing into a worthless and unhelpful object.

Instead, we must do the opposite of what we want: don’t speak of it. By not spreading the word as much as possible and by keeping it away from public, it can truly retain its power. However, it must not seem like this because it is disgusting but more so because it is so valuable that only those who have a true desire or will to try it should, therefore keeping it used in an optimal way by those who genuinely want it.

In order for something to remain special, it mustn’t be spread around to everyone and instead kept only for those who look for it.
