# Work for oneself, not for others
Realizing that one has free will to pick any kind of work or hobby is liberating. One can choose exactly what one wants and is not constrained by what other people want nor what society wants. Once one has taken such a role, the role gradually begins to shape them according to its demands. However, the role was only taken for the improvement of the self, and once one realizes that it is not benefiting oneself any more, one moves on to a different role.

Jobs and hobbies and such things become means of transforming oneself. However, this is damaging towards society as a whole. Long-term goals, training other people and gradual improvement of the work one does no longer is possible through this regard of such work. The view of work not as a part of oneself, but as something that changes oneself, makes it so that being used as a tool is not an option for such a person. It means that the role has to always benefit oneself, and if it no longer does this, then it is pointless.

By taking a unique role however, and letting it become oneself and using discipline to stick to it, even when it does not transform oneself further or start to become boring, one can help develop society as a whole. This is not damaging society any more and is different from the beliefs from long ago, where work was predestined to oneself.

By realizing that work is merely a role that one can play, one utilizes work for transformation but will not let oneself be used from the work in a way that doesn’t benefit oneself, leading to a damaged society overall.
