# Art creates meaning
Nihilists firmly believe that reality is cruel, and this is true. Reality itself has no inherent meaning and ultimately, people fall into despair. Some believe that if they act good, then they can be good people and thus have a meaning to live. But these people will also fall into despair, because what happens when they can no longer uphold that utter impossibility? No, it is through art that one can find life in living.

Confronting life with pure honesty will drive a person to despair. Such cases can lead to suicide, for existence is wrought with thoughts of the cruel, meaninglessness and chaotic nature of reality. If we were to base ourselves on being morally good and have good virtues in this life, we would also be brought to utter depression. One slip, and a person falls from doing good to doing bad. No, it cannot be that one can feel ashamed of themselves through such a human error in the absurdism of life. 

Instead, it is through art that life can become and remain worth living, no matter what human errors occurs throughout it. Through art can we derive the appearances of the hero and the fool, of good and bad. These appearances are worth striving for. It is through these appearances, that the view of life can be seen through an artistic lens. Then can a person begin to find meaning in life and see existence not as pointless, but as an individual aspiration for self-transformation into a creation they deem worthy; through art.

Seeing reality honestly will drive a person to despair, and it is through art that this reality can be reinterpreted and seen as a life-affirming drive to self-improvement.
