# Overcoming without end
Isn’t it weird how it seems like a person can never be happy when achieving a goal? It’s almost like that goal seems to never be able to be reached, and that even before achieving it, another ten goals appear even further beyond it. It makes one feel helpless and makes one want to stop believing in a final end goal that one can reach. And maybe that’s for the better.

When it comes to defeating challenges, overcoming enemies and reaching goals that one sets, nothing will properly last. There will be no final end to any of these things. There will always be another goal, another enemy, another state of mind, etc. that one wants to achieve. Therefore, having a final state is an impossible goal to have in mind that sets one up for disappointment and failure.

Thus, one must act in the present, disregarding the future and the past and letting ones current actions be right. One must act as the human spirit wants to act and therefore must disregard others ideas or the belief of something above oneself. The self is the only thing upon which one must act upon, and here it is more important to act more plentifully rather than more qualitatively, for the end goal has no meaning.

Despite this, it is important to keep oneself lucid about this belief of meaninglessness in the universe. One must constantly retain this distance from all life is and the fact that transcending it or trying to overcome that is impossible. It is only necessary to keep the repetition of fighting against a problem and then either overcoming it or failing it.

Overcoming one’s failures continuously and having no end goal lets one decide to accumulate as many experiences as possible
