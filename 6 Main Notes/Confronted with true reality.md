# Confronted with true reality
There have been a couple of times in my life where I’ve felt extremely lucid towards life, or as people online say, gained consciousness. By this it is meant when you make the realization, that everything you wanted, hoped for, are is completely made up and at the end of the day, there is nothing for you. So what happens when this lucidity occurs and why?

Reality, society and the world live in a state of ignorance towards the inherent truth of existence. Realizing that nothing has any meaning and everything that we do is pointless and that we are all hoping for the next day, the next day which might be our death, is absolutely horrible. Therefore, not ever coming up with the thought or straight up not thinking about it removes that horrible feeling.

The reason for this feeling comes up due to our rationality. We constrict the world into human terms and want everything to come up logically, rationally. It should make sense, and if it doesn’t then it’s wrong. Except it was wrong from the start. The world and life is by default not rational, which makes trying to put meaning onto it impossible, making that feeling impossible to remove.

This sentiment also finds itself unto us ourselves. We will always be a stranger to ourselves. Our own beliefs and hopes collapse upon us once we make the realization. Future becomes a vague thing that one doesn’t know how to prepare for any more. It seems hopeless, meaningless. Perhaps one can drown out the feeling through distraction and things like that. But, that realization and feeling will keep coming back. And then the question is posed: 

Should I do the right thing and commit suicide now, or do I continue on living with false and irrational hope?
