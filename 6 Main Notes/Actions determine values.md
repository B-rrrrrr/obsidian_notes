# Actions determine values
When one wants to improve themselves or to find a purpose, usually they focus on what has to be eliminated first. They tear down so that they can rebuild. This can result in them focusing on getting rid of addictions, bad habits, things that don’t make them happy, etc. But this never leads to a proper way of living. It always fails, and they retract back into old habits.

The reason for this, is simply because they focus too much on the improvement. Any action done that goes against their goal is a failure in themselves. And so they keep on pushing against this negativity constantly until they eventually break and return to the old state of self. It is reactive to life.

The solution here is to instead do what is worth doing in life. By taking action in life, following one’s passions and letting life live itself, one finds the virtues and values that truly matter. Addictions will fall away, habits will reform themselves, and life will in general restructure itself based on those true passions and devotions for life that one has. There is no need for negative values or virtues. Instead, these things simply don’t have the space or the opportunity to exist in the life that one creates.

Values and virtues emerge from living the life that one wants to.
