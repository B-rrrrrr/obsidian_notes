# Finding hope in philosophy
In our meaningless world that is completely irrational, there remains a natural and human desire to want to make the world rational. We want to bring the world down to a human level to comprehend it. But, by doing this, we are deciding to create meaning out of nothing, a false hope, a nonexistent interpretation.

However, most people still do not want to accept this, either through ignorance, distraction, or worst case, philosophy. By believing in a philosophy of any kind or in an act of transcendence like believing in a God or believing in an afterlife, one is beginning to attach meaning to events, by finding proper ways to live, and by finding hope in the hopeless. Even in death there is hope through thoughts of heaven for example. Suicide itself is finding life not worth living, but this kind of philosophical suicide is still finding life not worth living and finding hope and meaning through ideas and thoughts.

Instead, one must have no hope and decide to accept that there is no meaning in the world. When answering the question of what does one live for, one must answer hopelessly, not because of nihilism, but because there is none to begin with. 

By trying to find valuable reasons to live in philosophy, one commits a psychological suicide that leaves one finding hope and meaning in a world that offers none.
