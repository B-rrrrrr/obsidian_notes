# Becoming worse through helping others
Morals, virtues and values. We all have certain thoughts of these things, and we feel as if ours were the better. We then tell others how good ours our, and that they should and need to follow them. Furthermore, we see these things as rules and regulations of how to live, and if one doesn’t abide by them, we try to force them to follow us.

However, changing a person like such is a difficult task and rarely works. See only the laws that countries use to try and stop drug use. It rarely works. And even more so, it changes everything for the worse. Drugs suddenly become more popular, people are forced to find even worse methods for obtaining them, and addiction rates rise. Through trying to improve the situation, it gets worse.

Instead, we should express our thoughts as they stand, not trying to force everyone to follow them. Through taking a stance, others can see it and maybe even decide to get behind it or follow it as well. This doesn’t require changing the stance, and rather promotes following one’s ideals to the maximum extent possible. Thinking back to the drug example, by letting people have the opportunity to have a safe method of acquiring drugs and letting people see the things that drugs actually do, it creates a mindset that lets people decide for themselves whether they want to do it or not.

Through trying to force others to follow one’s thoughts in the manner of a law, one ends up harming everything else in the process.
