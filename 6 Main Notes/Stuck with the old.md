# Stuck with the old
For the longest time I was stuck playing Genshin Impact even though it wasn’t providing me much joy. It used to, but the more I played it, the more I stopped finding anything fulfilling with it. I was trapped and hopelessly addicted to it. And yet I kept playing it despite this. Why? And why does this happen for almost everything I do?

When we start making something into a habit, we become attached to it. For a long time it is difficult to get it into a daily routine, but once one gets used to it, it becomes much easier to work with. This creates a sense of obstinancy, where one keeps to it no matter the circumstances. And this is usually a good thing; one keeps the power and motivation to do the thing, even when it is harder to keep it up. But, this has consequences.

Through the obstinancy that is created through discipline, stopping becomes much harder. Not doing it creates a sense of guilt, or an itch rises up within the body to do it. Not accomplishing that which one said to do disproves the loyalty that one should have and shows a conflict within oneself. It used to bring me fulfilment so it should keep doing it, no? Or, the inertia of the thing keeps one stuck onto it, in the hopes that something new will result from it or keep giving one what it used to give.

But maybe it would be better to stop it? And in a lot of cases it is. When stuck in this cycle of discipline, it can actually be more detrimental than helpful at some point. But realizing this is difficult when trapped and requires an outside view or a hard hit of realization in one’s life. For escaping Genshin Impact, I played Ultrakill, which showed me what true fun is and gave me the realization that the former wasn’t giving me joy in life.

Once a habit is formed and discipline followed, seeing the bad within that habit is difficult. Instead, one keeps following old guidelines out of a sense of hypocrisy to oneself, inertia, pride, or clinging on to old things.
