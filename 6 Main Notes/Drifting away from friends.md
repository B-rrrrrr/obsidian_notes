# Drifting away from friends
There have been multiple occasions where I’ve had extremely strong friendships that ended up wilting away. I thought this was bad, and so I did everything in my power to keep them alive, to no avail. Eventually, I accepted the fact that it was no more, but it is only now that I realize that this is actually for the better and that if we meet again it makes it only that much more fulfilling and joyful.

We all have our own goals and move towards them individually. Where we end up going is and should not be decided by others. But, friendships can grow from these places where we go to. When advancing towards my objectives, I might meet another with whom I find comfort or joy in interacting with, and we become friends.

But, since one must constantly progress, we will eventually drift apart. Even though it felt as if it might last forever, eventually the ways will differ, and we will not see each other again for a while. This is no cause for despair, though, but rather a sign of progression. One is not stagnant but moving.

The fact that our friendships change makes the thought of previous friendships only that much better. Perhaps at some point we shall meet again or get closer to each other again, and wouldn’t it be that much more joyful to see one another changed for the better?

Distance from friends will and should happen, since everyone is constantly changing and results in much more fulfilling friendships.
