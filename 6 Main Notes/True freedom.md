# True freedom

Two fathers and their children enter a grocery store. The one father lets his child pick whatever they want. The child ends up filling the shopping cart with nothing but sweets and junk food. The second father, however, has taught his child the importance of a balanced diet and lets his child have the choice to choose between that which is healthy and that which is unhealthy. His son fills up the shopping cart with only some sweets and junk food and has prioritized nutrition over pleasure. Now, which child has experienced more freedom?

This is a scenario presented in Infinite Jest and displays the two types of freedom that can be understood. The first type of freedom, and also the type most commonly referred to, is the *freedom-from* type. This removes all boundaries and restrictions and allows people to freely choose whatever they want. In Infinite Jest it is presumed that a person under this kind of freedom will always satisfy their deepest desires and pleasures, because the choice is given to them. This makes a person pick poorer choices as they themselves and their pleasure comes before everything else.

The other kind of freedom is the *freedom-to*. People under this freedom understand the outcomes of all choices and know which is better for themselves. Thus they have the freedom to choose good or bad or to strike a balance between the two. Therefore, such a person makes informed choices.

Looking at these two types of freedom it is clear that the *freedom-to* is the real type of freedom that one can have. Only through understanding can one decide to pick something over the other. If there is no understanding then one cannot make a choice as the decision will be made from desire. As Marathe says in Infinite Jest: “How is there freedom to choose if one does not learn how to choose?”

True freedom comes not from choices, but from understanding choices.
