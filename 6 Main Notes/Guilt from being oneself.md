# Guilt from being oneself
A dream of mine for a long time has been to become a game designer, that has now expanded into being a musician as well as artist and novelist. However, these ideas of what I want to become into question often by others, since I feel like they don’t benefit society that much. Being a doctor would be much better, no? And so, every time someone asked me I felt a deep sense of shame for being myself. Having experimental interests as well did not help whatsoever. So I tried to do what society told me, but I ended up feeling empty. Thus, over time I’ve noticed that it is much more important to be who you are, than what others tell you: The guilt of the inside is far greater than the guilt of the outside world.

Through the different pressures that society forces upon us, we feel like there is only one way of truly living. Deviating from this path feels wrong, and it makes a person feel guilty for engaging with other things unrelated to the path or even contradictory to it. This guilt weighs upon them and makes them act as society wants them to.

Except, in this act of being a good citizen, they still feel a sense of guilt. The reason is a lack of self-fulfilment. By doing the things others tell you, now the guilt arises not out of pressure from the outside world, but from the inside. A person’s own self notices the nonfulfilment and wants their own values satisfied, not those from the outside.

Therefore, one must seek to do and commit the exceptional. By not conforming to the things others say and focusing on the inner, the inner, deeper, and much more important guilt can be eliminated, leading to self-fulfilment. However, eliminating the guilt of society requires deviating from the herd, a different task entirely.

Feeling guilt for conforming to society and feeling guilt for not conforming to inner values; the former is the least important.
