# To create, we must understand
When a person does something, they believe that they are fully conscious of doing the action. They can reasonably deduce why they did it, and why it was right or wrong. Except, they can’t. Even deducing the morality of the thing is something that has its own origin. Beyond the consciousness, there is something else that is inaccessible to us: the subconscious. Thinking that all can be obtained from the consciousness is a naïve belief and by following the consciousness, it is like one follows orders without properly understanding them.

Most people's values are not their own or created from themselves. Rather, they originate from habit, societal conditioning, upbringing, etc. Thus, the reasons for people acting the way they do can be contradictory in the eyes of others. But thinking that what one is doing is universally right and moral is a selfish way of looking at it, and exactly why morality is not something that can be determined. Everyone acts from an origin, and the determination of whether this origin is moral also has an origin. It's Gödel all the way down.

Therefore, morality cannot be determined universally and everyone’s values must be created not from others, but from oneself. But it is impossible to create actual honest values, if one believes in universal morality or has faith in consciousness. One must understand the origin from which one came from and understand the forces one cannot choose before one can create own honest values. Likewise, one must understand that one’s actions cannot be determined universally moral, actions instead must be taken with responsibility and explanation based on one’s own values.

In order to create actual new and personal values, one must understand the factors that aren’t controlled by oneself, realize that actions cannot be judged universally and must be explained by oneself and thus should be created consciously, rather than merely obeying them.
