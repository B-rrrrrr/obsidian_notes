# Isn't everyone an addict?

In our life we will definitely eventually become addicted to something. It is the way our minds our structured. But the real question is, do I need help against my addiction? 

Infinite Jest mentions how every one-in-a-million times a person comes in AA with a very mild addiction and doesn’t actually require the extreme methods that AA brings. However, if you think you are this person, I’m sorry to say, you’re an addict. 

Then there is also the logic that is made that by saying you don’t have an addiction, even if you don’t have one, by AA logic you find yourself in [[Denial]]. This means that you require even more help than someone who has admitted to having an addiction. 

So by these three lines of thought, isn’t everyone in the world an addict and by trying to deny the accusations you are only proving the fact more so that you have a problem?

While we all find ourselves in a constant battle of balance and controlling temptation the real question is, do I need help in combating it? And if you don’t, you will understand this on a subconscious level. You don’t need to make up a highly intellectual and analytical approach to why you don’t need help. You would only do this if you truly are in [[Denial]] and want to try and prove that you’re not.

We are all addicted to something but whether we need serious help for these problems is a different question. By trying to reason your way out of help you are only proving that you need it. If you don’t you will know this on a subconscious level.
