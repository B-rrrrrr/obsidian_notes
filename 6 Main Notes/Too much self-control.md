# Too much self-control
Discipline, restraint and inhibition are all means of self-control. And one is told to follow these things so that one can be happy. Without this control of the self, one spirals into the abyss of addictions or bad decisions or general unhappiness. But there is also a mistake within too much self-control.

Through self-control, at every occurrence when the body finds something that speaks to it in some way, a fear arises at the loss of self-control. Even if this thing is something that is beneficial to the body, something like love, the natural reaction is a distrust at the thing. One becomes to self-conscious of oneself and one’s desires.

Still, greatness can come through self-control. Constant, uninterrupted and concentrated work will lead to great things, but wouldn’t one be more human and more joyful experiencing the natural aspects of human nature? Constant self-control only leads to a distrust in everyone and everything, leaving one with nothing to learn from. One never learns to like something, only to fear.

An overabundance of self-control makes one fear everything and not let one learn from one’s mistakes.
