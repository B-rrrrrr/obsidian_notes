# Learning to love
It took me a long time before I could not hate myself any more. And even then I wouldn’t say that I love myself. In fact, I see this for all the friends and acquaintances that I have. They aren’t people that I liked at first, but over time came to love. This process is surprisingly simple, and I have described it here as Nietzsche has put it.

In order to love something, one must have let it be itself and one must endure it despite everything. Through discovering the thing, one must let it exist in all its strangeness and unfamiliarity and exercise patience for it. It is not necessary to change it so that it can appeal to oneself more, but rather to let it be itself.

Slowly, gradually, one becomes accustomed to it. It becomes a fact of life, something that is expected and appreciated. In fact, one realizes that if it were gone, one would miss it greatly. It is at this point when one has truly loved the thing.

This reigns true for all types of love, even the love of oneself. One must live as one does, realizing that it is strange to familiarize with something that one has barely any control over. But eventually, one becomes used to oneself and grows to love all the aspects that make one oneself.

Loving something is gradually process, that comes from patience and kindness until it becomes a part of one that makes life something better.
