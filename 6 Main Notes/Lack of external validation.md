# Lack of external validation
Prometheus defied Zeus by giving humanity back the fire that Zeus stole from them. He punished Prometheus by chaining him against a rock and has an eagle fly down each day to eat his liver, which regenerates the following day. Despite the sacrifice that Prometheus made, most humans still end up making their sacrifices to and praising Zeus, not Prometheus. But he does not suffer from this lack of recognition, instead he remains proud.

This is because the worst kind of suffering does not come from his actual punishment. If one has acted according to one’s own values, then one has realized themselves and obtained true confidence and meaning in one’s actions. By being punished for what one stood for is almost a kind of defiance against the norm, further establishing that one acted from one’s own will.

Instead, truly great suffering comes from the comparison and envy towards others. If Prometheus were to not be confident within himself and his actions, and make his self-worth dependent on others, then he would be in utter dismay at the lack of validation and recognition he received for his actions. 

If a person depends on others, once that external validation vanishes, then they suffer immensely.
