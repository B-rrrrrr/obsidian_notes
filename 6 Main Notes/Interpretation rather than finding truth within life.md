# Interpretation rather than finding truth within life
I’ve seen many pieces of art that seem to be completely devoid of meaning. Stuff that’s just bonkers and where I believe the artist just did some random stuff and called it a day. But, we can either disagree with this fact and try to find truth or meaning within the art, or we can make our own interpretations of the art, making it something worth looking at. This also rings true for life itself.

Life is inherently meaningless and harsh. Most of the things we do in life are repetitive and pointless to us in the long run. And yet, despite this, we try and find the hidden truth within this life. Except we find none, since life has none. And so we turn to things greater than us like Gods in order to transcend this life, but at the end of the day we do not accept life as it really is and instead try to find something to either give it truth or find truth within it.

In art, artists take aspects of life and interpret them in new ways. They create pieces of art that reflect life but don’t explain it. Their artworks can appear calming or chaotic, and yet it is up to us to take their work and see how we react to them. This can be very different depending on the art piece and from them, we derive interpretations of ourselves, life and the universe.

However, we need to take this way of looking at art and apply it to life. Once we do this, life is not a search for meaning, but a search for interpretation. Life is inherently meaningless, yes, but within that we can change the way we see appearances and interpret them differently. Hardship can turn from meaningless repetition to slow improvement, thus making life a thing worth experiencing.

Finding truth within meaningless life is impossible, instead, we must change our interpretation of life.
