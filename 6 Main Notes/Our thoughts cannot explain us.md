# Our thoughts cannot explain us
Gedanken sind die Schatten unserer Empfindungen – immer dunkler, leerer, einfacher als diese.

Thoughts often arrive far too late to explain ourselves. When an action is committed, thoughts usually come after the fact, not before. These thoughts give mere reasoning about the action and do not explain why the action was committed in the first place. Even thoughts from beforehand usually do not give proper reasoning to the action itself, and instead give uncertainties of the future.

Since we are such complicated beings and are made up of so many different things, thoughts are incapable of expressing ourselves. Thoughts cannot capture the deep intrinsic complexity of the self and instead simplify it. Instead of seeing all the moving parts, we merely see the most surface level parts that help us comprehend ourselves. Our thoughts are simplifications of ourselves.

Therefore, our subconscious is unreachable by our thoughts and trying to know ourselves is impossible. We as rational creatures have the desire to find methods with which to understand ourselves, or to simply contemplate about our condition to comprehend ourselves. But this task is Sisyphean, since our instincts and actions conflict and interact with each other in many weird and unidentifiable ways, making the self constantly change over time and conflict with previous thoughts and ideas.

However, despite this incomprehensibility of ourselves, we should not feel despair. Rather, we should realize that our consciousness and subconsciousness should not be something to find understanding in. It is merely one aspect of ourselves that acts in mysterious ways. Our self is not comprised solely of consciousness, but is instead conflicting, vague and entwined with many other aspects.

We should learn to accept the fact that we are made up of many different parts that cannot be explained with one simple fact or by simply thinking about ourselves.
