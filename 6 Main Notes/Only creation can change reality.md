# Only creation can change reality
The way things appear is more important than what they are.

Names are given to things arbitrarily, as are the values and inherent meaning we assign to them. Once named, these things will shape themselves gradually to that which they are named. Its appearance becomes reality. Only after given such a form, can a thing seem real to us. The actual thing itself is not what makes it itself.

Some may find despair in this, and think therefore that reality is built on a weak foundation. They think that because of their despair they can see no meaning in a world built upon appearances. Nothing seems real in that case.

However, these meanings and values can only be changed by those who create. An appearance cannot lose its meaning just because it doesn’t seem real. Because: the way things appear seem more real than what actually is real. The only way a thing can change its meaning to the world, in such a case, is by changing its appearance, its name. Not by referring to it by its real status.

Appearances gradually shape what seems real, and meaning is derived from these appearances. However, they can only change through the power of creation and transformation.
