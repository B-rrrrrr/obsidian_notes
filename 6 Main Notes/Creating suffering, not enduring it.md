# Creating suffering, not enduring it
When one finally realizes the greater truths about oneself or the world, it can be painful. Making the realization that everything is pointless, that there is no grander hope in the world is hard to live with, and many don’t. Lots give in to the pain through suicides, and yet there are others still who decide to live on. They endure the pain, but won’t do anything because of it. They become the nihilists, the ones who find nothing in anything. But these are the weak ones. 

The truly strong ones are the ones who not only endure the pain, but don’t let themselves struggle with it. They don’t go into the nihilistic route, they realize the pain is necessary. They don’t give in to the doubts of their beliefs when they’ve been disproven. Instead, they establish themselves again and continue on in the face of suffering. 

In fact, what truly sets them apart from the weak is the ability to inflict pain unto themselves willingly. To want to go through intense realizations and not just happen upon them sets them apart from others. And through this suffering they don’t want to just endure it and remain the same, slowly collapsing from the despair from it, but instead to change oneself into something better.

Suffering by itself is not the objective of the great ones, rather, it is becoming the source of the suffering and working through it that makes one great.
