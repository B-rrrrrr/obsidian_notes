# How to improve oneself
When a person improves themselves significantly, can’t you say that this person has changed fundamentally? And if a person continues this improvement constantly, what makes them similar to themselves in the past, if anything? Isn’t this a new person, completely different from their past selves, a being that has overcome limits that defined these past selves?

In Infinite Jest, this is shown through tennis. Two opponents meet and battle against each other, except the true opponent is not the other person, but rather the self. The goal of each round of tennis is to defeat this self and to be better than this true opponent. In other words, one must become better than oneself. 

The way this is achieved is by realizing the limits that one has and transcending them, breaking them and overcoming them. Only in such a way can the current self be defeated and be replaced by the winner: a new self that has improved. It is through killing oneself over and over again that progress can be achieved.

In order to improve, current limits must be transcended, and the current self defeated through the transcendence, therefore replacing the limits and the self.
