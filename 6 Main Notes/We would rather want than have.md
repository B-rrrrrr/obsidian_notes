# We would rather want than have
Everyone knows what happens when someone finally gets what they want: they realize it doesn’t matter as much as they thought it would. Look at all the extremely famous rock stars and how once they’ve reached their goal they suddenly realize that it doesn’t fulfil them as a person and in the worst case scenario they end up killing themselves. It’s tragic, and yet it’s a pattern that’s been repeated countless times. But how do people reach this stage?

It all begins with the wanting of something. We want to have a toy, we want money, we want fame, we want to be fit, etc. And people in this state actually find themselves happier than those who have actually achieved their goals. In Infinite Jest, it's commented on how the younger and lower ranked people in Tennis have more joy than those higher up. This is due to the fact that it’s invigorating to chase something. But once this something has been reached, then the person realizes that these achievements do not confer to interior worth. 

Once this stage has been reached, people lose hope. Usually when the middle-age crisis is talked about, it refers to exactly this state: I’ve achieved everything I wanted, and yet I’m not happy or really fulfilled. Now people begin to develop an empty and numb feeling within themselves. They realize that that which used to give them self-worth now doesn’t, and now they don’t know what to do with themselves any more. And now the despair and hopelessness begins, and it’s a downward spiral all the way down. The only way to avoid this is by realizing where true fulfilment and self-worth comes from.

Wanting something is invigorating but achieving that something does not confer to the interior worth we thought it would have on us.
