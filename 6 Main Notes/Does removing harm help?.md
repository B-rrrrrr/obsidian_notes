# Does removing harm help?
We all know the situation, when you want to get something harmful to your wellbeing out of your life. Whether that be drugs, alcohol, television, computers, etc. it is usually better to not have them in daily life. But, don’t they come right back again? Simply removing them from daily life seems to be not enough, because either something just as harmful takes place or the harmful substance finds itself back into life again? So, what was done wrong?

The reason for this, is because the root problem was not addressed. If something is being problematic, it usually is not because the substance itself is harmful, but the use of it is. An addict is not addicted because the substance is addictive, but more so that they need it in order to get through the day. 

Eliminating this substance from their lives does not change the need they experience and makes recovery impossible. They will come back either for it, or even worse, for something else. I say this is worse, because it seems as if they’ve improved but in fact have just replaced the habit for something just as bad, but don’t even realize it.

In order to properly deal with such a scenario, thoughts and patterns must be analysed to find the root problem and one must address this. Combining this with replacing the need for the substance with something actually worthwhile, such as exercise, will successfully solve the need for it and will help for improvement and recovery.

Merely removing a harmful substance will not solve the problem at hand. Instead, the root problem must be addressed.
