# What makes something or somebody special?
In the little prince he finds a rose on his planet suddenly. It tells him, that it is the only rose in the universe, and the little prince falls in love with it. Eventually the little prince decides to leave his planet and falls onto the earth, where he finds a garden full of hundereds of roses and he wonders, why should I care about my rose when there are hundereds here?

The reason why his rose is special and unique to him is revealed by the fox. The fox explains, that it is through caring and loving his rose that it automatically makes his rose different from the rest. It makes it unique purely by the way that he interacts with it. It is not the rose itself that is important, but more so seeing the rose in the way that it is on the inside that makes it unique from all the hundreds of roses in the world. This is the reason why it is better to have one rose that can be cared for and made unique than just owning hundreds of roses.

Through spending time away from his rose amplifies this effect even more, since the little prince cannot feel the pleasure of seeing his rose and instead has to focus on thinking about the way he cares for it and the way that it cares about him as well. It forces him to engage with the correct way of *seeing*.

This also extends beyond the life of the rose itself. Even if the rose dies, despite how much sorrow he might have, the care that he has given the rose does not die. Despite everything that may happen, the outside is not what makes the rose unique and important to him. The outside may change but the inside is what makes it worth while.

The most important things are blind to the eye. Therefore one must see not with the eyes, but with the heart.
