# Trying to be better than others
Something encouraged over and over again in society is the need to be better than others. One must become better and strive to produce better work than those who came before. This can be with regard to parents but also to others, like teachers or other artists. But, there is a danger that comes with this line of thinking, since it creates a need to improve with an origin of anxiety and not an origin of creativity and joy. Working with the former in mind will not lead to a joyous life but rather despair.

When wanting to become better than those before, a need to be constantly working and being productive is produced. One has to work harder, not because they want to, but because they have to in order to reach their goal. This drive is amplified even more, if the person they are imitating has also worked extremely hard in their life. By doing this, failing becomes not an option and a growing sense of anxiety is created through such a mindset. Worryingly, productivity becomes the life goal of this person.

This anxiety will eventually lead to a collapse of this person, since their life will not feel lived in by they themselves, but as others want it to be. Thus, one must not strive to be better or work harder than others. One must create one’s own goals and values to reach and strive for, noticing failure not as a horrible condition, but as a step on the path. By following work with this in mind, eventual fulfilment of these goals will lead to true happiness and not despair.

Trying to be better than others creates a sense of anxiety and will eventually lead to despair, whereas striving for own goals creates leads to overcoming personal limits and finding true happiness within that.
