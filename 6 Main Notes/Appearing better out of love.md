# Appearing better out of love
There is this strange thing that occurs when two people love another, where both will start to hide various aspects about themselves, usually the weakest parts. They want to appear better than they are to the other. Now, I used to think that this was done out of a stupid, innate and selfish reason, but in actuality it is something much more beautiful.

When we love someone, we want to appear as strong and capable as possible. In a way, we want to appear god-like towards them, to appear as a source of stability and refuge. We should be a source of comfort for them and help elevate their lives and not tear them down, since love is more about the other than us. 

Therefore, this need to appear stronger than we are is not formed out of vanity, but rather out of true love. We don’t want our lover to suffer from the weakest parts of ourselves that might cause them harm. We want the best for those whom we love, and so we mask our weaknesses and hide them. 

We conceal our weaknesses to not cause discomfort for our loved ones.
