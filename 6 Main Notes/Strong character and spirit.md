# Strong character and spirit
Character dictates one’s ability to stay grounded in one’s beliefs. Character constitutes discipline and consistency in their work. A person with a strong character has a strong will that endures even in the toughest of conditions and forms a consistent self.

Spirit is the part that is imaginative and free roaming. Spirit looks towards novelty and is flexible; it changes based on the conditions it’s in. A person with a brilliant spirit is constantly creative, questioning, curious, and evolving.

When growing oneself and reaching higher and higher limits, these two aspects will be developed. However, by only focusing on one whether accidentally or on purpose, the other becomes neglected. Through this negligence, even if one rises high, there will be an instability at that height. A person with too much spirit will constantly think but never act, whereas a person with a far too strong character will not change at all and be rigid in ways that are perhaps damaging to the self, mentally or physically.

A balance between these two characteristics is required to reach high, and remain high.
