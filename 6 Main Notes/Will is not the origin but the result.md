# Will is not the origin but the result
When a drug addict finally quits, the drug people will congratulate them on being stronger than their inner desires. Their will has let them quit, and this will has finally appeared and acted upon them. Except, this is not the full picture. The will to quit is not something that magically appears, but rather is the result of many other smaller things gathering that culminate into the Will.

We have an oversimplification of the will. When we do something, we do not acknowledge the forces that have acted upon us to act. We just act. To us, the will is a magical force that intervenes randomly, somewhere in the darkest recesses of ourselves or even not in ourselves but in some God.

But the will is a culmination of suffering. Through our knowledge of pleasure and pain can we notice when we experience uncomfort. As more and more events of suffering culminate within ourselves, our will is built. The will that acts is the result of so much pain, that the self cannot tolerate it any more and thus uses its will to rid itself of the pain in order to feel joy. 

Still, the self has to interpret the culmination and see if a will is required. For the drug addict, the pain and suffering caused by the drug has to be so immense and noticeably caused by the drug itself, that it outweighs the pleasure experienced by the drug. It is only through this inner, unconscious reflection, that the will can finally act upon the self.

Will is not a magical force that changes us, but the result from the self to a culmination of suffering.
