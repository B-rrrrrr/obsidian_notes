# Belief in virtues
Virtues do not exist, only the belief in them.

Virtues are not created by oneself, but rather inherited by society or got from people like our parents. However, many of these virtues are outdated and no longer apply to current life, virtues of marriage for example, but still they are followed through the inertia of the belief. Since the virtue is inherited like this, it doesn’t require a reason, it just needs to exist and be followed. Virtues need to be believed to exist.

Being told what is good and what is bad is not based on the thoughts of oneself, but of the thoughts from others. If what I’m doing seems good rather than is good, then it is good. This interpretation of actions leads to the fact that others can differ massively in their belief. Take the different religions for example. But since virtues are based in belief, if one were to stop believing in said virtues, then all the actions that one does would feel pointless and meaningless. By doing that, the true nature of virtues is revealed.

Feeling accomplished for one’s actions does not come from the action itself, but the belief within the action.
