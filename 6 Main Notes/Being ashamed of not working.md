# Being ashamed of not working
Capitalism and the current society has created different thoughts about one’s work. Namely, working is the most important thing that one can do in life. In order to fulfil this need, one constantly compares themselves with others, trying to do the same thing better, or in less time, or to do more with the work. One works so much that they become fatigued by the work. The only purpose in life for such people feels like work. If it isn’t, then they are living wrong.

Breaking away from work is also seen as bad by society. Being caught doing something for oneself, or not working as much as someone else, or taking time off is seen as laziness or requires an excuse of some sort. It ends up creating a sense of shame when time is spent enjoying oneself and pursuing actual life. 

Through working so much and putting so much emphasis and importance on the work, one becomes immensely fatigued by it. Any free time is spent not on enjoying art, culture and such things, but rather on relaxing with it. A demand arises not for art that changes, but for art that comforts.

However, this used to be the reverse in past times. Working was seen as an act of shame and only done when the need arose, whilst free time and living life were seen as noble and worthy of honour. Look only at how slaves did most of the work; they were not seen as honourable people and instead as people doing the things no one wanted to do. Working was showing that one required something else in life to live it.

Making work the most important thing in life makes one feel ashamed for not working and instead spent living.
