# Uncertainty over certainty
The ship parts and there is a joy in looking at the horizon at the large world that you have left to explore. So many unknowns await you and the ship sails forth, you impatient and dying to find out more. The still water is constantly around you, but stare at it for too long, and you find yourself stuck, unmoving. This is why one must keep looking to the horizon, looking for land, and not to stare into the abyss of still water.

Those who are truly happy and find fulfilment within life have an overflow of life’s energy. They constantly look towards the future, have a haste within the present and find the past unimportant. They look towards the future with a joy found within the challenges that life  brings them, and they accept it as is.

Death is something that constantly lurks in this future, though. It is the one certainty of life that once acknowledged, brings despair unto one. In order to avoid this despair, one must decide to ignore that fact and instead look out unto the uncertainties rather than that that is certain. Then one can truly live life rather than fear death.

But just ignoring the fact of death is not enough to achieve this overflow of life-affirming energy. One must constantly put in the effort of looking into the horizon of the best and worst that life may or may not bring, embracing all of it and putting death aside in order to live life fully.

To live life with full commitment and joy, one must look into the uncertainties of the future rather than the certain (death).
