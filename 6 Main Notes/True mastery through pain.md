# True mastery through pain

Those who want to become true experts in their craft, to really take their love of something to the next level, will become enveloped by it. Anything else that doesn’t help them achieve their mastery becomes pointless, and they become ever more like their craft. A person like that becomes not only the master of their craft, but the victim. The price it pays is the disassociation towards all others.

But people want this. People want to become masters, but the price one must pay for it is something no one wants to do. One wants to become the master through comfort and convenience, not pain and hard work. But once one does this, one becomes the person who represents all, but is nothing. One has nothing on which one can stand on, and one becomes nothing.

Even being a genius in the craft will not help escape the pain that comes from being a master. All genius and talent does is hide the fact that one is a fraud for longer. For, the true masters of their craft experience bad consciousness at what they do, they don’t understand the pain, they doubt themselves, they realize the torment that the mastery is putting them through and how it removes themselves from society. Those who don’t follow that path of pain lack that.

Becoming a master or an expert at one’s passion requires an immense amount of hard work and pain that cannot be faked by others, and if it is faked, then one is nothing.
