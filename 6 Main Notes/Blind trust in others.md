# Blind trust in others
There have been so many times when I’ve been unsure of what to do or where to go in life, that I become almost paralysed with my decision-making, and so I put my trust into something or someone else. This would be anything from a dead author to an AI, but am I really becoming myself or just what others want me to be?

We all have inherent beliefs and values, but at times we can find doubt within these things. We are unsure if what we’re doing is right, or even if there is a right, and so we turn to others for help. 

However, by taking others opinions as the truth and following it even if it goes beyond what one thought beforehand, it can be detrimental to oneself. Blindly trusting others to be better than oneself is not a way to become oneself. Instead, one becomes like the others, following what they think and not what one thinks themselves.

This lies true for anything, whether that be AI, society, friends, or dead authors, no one knows really what is true and what is best; that decision must be let up to oneself, not someone else.

Blindly accepting what others think regardless of their status isn’t beneficial for true self development.
