# Appearing profound vs being profound
There have been many people who like to make vague statements. They intentionally hide what they mean in their statements through strange wordings and weird sentences. I’ve read many authors who do this (I’m looking at you Baudrillard) and have always thought that my understanding was too little to understand it. That simply, it was my fault that I couldn’t comprehend the lines. But, in actuality, it is actually the author who is at fault. Those who have something profound to say form their thoughts clearly, whereas others don’t in order to appear clearer.

Those who are profound try to seem as clear as possible to others, who may not be on their same level. Being profound includes having deepened understanding, developed oneself beyond previous limits, and having extended one’s horizons far beyond that of what they would’ve normally had. These lead to an inner complexity that doesn’t need to be more complicated to explain, instead it should be shown as straight forward as possible to others so that it make sense to them. 

However, those who haven’t reached this stage of profundity abuse a method of seeming more profound than they are. They obscure themselves. By making vague statements and trying to hide their intentions or thoughts to others, they create an aura around themselves of incomprehension. This complexity appears to the masses not as a weakness of the person, but of themselves. Since they cannot understand the full depth of someone or something, it must be that the person is too complex for them to understand. This makes this intention of depth appear deep, despite it being the opposite way around.

Things that cannot be comprehended may appear to have depth and be profound, but they may be masking their actuality and abuse self-doubt.
