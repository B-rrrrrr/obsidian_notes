# Death of God
God is dead. A famous phrase uttered by Nietzsche and one that has been falsely interpreted many times. With this phrase, Nietzsche does not mean to say that God is literally dead through an event, but rather, our belief in God has dried up and wilted. Most people have become proud atheists and do not see the wrong in that. They do not understand, that not believing in something greater than the self will lead to despair. The way to not succumb to this, is to become one’s own “God”.

Through historical developments, and especially through the Age of Enlightenment, has the desire to believe in the Christian God diminished. People have begun to think that it is unnecessary to have such a belief and have become atheists, nor do they see what is wrong in doing that. They do not understand, what not having a means of transcendence does to a person.

Namely, all values become groundless and utterly meaningless. Without a thing greater than the self, giving meaning to the things around us, everything loses value. While one can still ride the wave of the shadow of God that is left behind, after enough generations all knowledge of this God will die out, and all knowledge of past meaning will be forgotten. These people become nihilists, entrenched in despair and unable to find something to get them out.

The only thing that can bring a person out of despair, is transcendence. God was an easy way of doing this, but without one, a person must become their own “God”. With this it is not meant something to worship, but rather, something that can create and transform the self. Without an outside force dictating what should and should not be, one must create these forces and create one’s own meaning and values to transcend the self. 

Without the outside forces of a God, everything becomes meaningless. To transcend this, one must create their own values and meaning to not succumb to despair.
