# We like similarities of ourselves
Throughout time but especially through the invention of the internet have we always tried to search for those who are like us. We love those people who give us praise and validation. In fact, we like this so much, that critiques seem harmful to us, and so we avoid them. By doing this, we only hear things that we ourselves know, and therefore lack the sight to see our own weaknesses and then lack the will or even need for self-improvement. 

We surround ourselves with those who comfort us, and thus in turn exclude those who challenge us. In excluding others, we try to disprove their theories of ourselves by instead focusing on the things said by those who comfort us, or we take their words not as truth but as insignificant nonsense that can be forgotten. This mindset realizes itself all the time: Even when with other people, we only hear or take to heart the things that we agree with. In that sense, we are always with ourselves, our thoughts, our minds and we do not notice our weaknesses.

By doing this, we create an environment that consists of only comfort and we do not challenge ourselves. We establish a fabricated society that only further deepens our self-worth and doesn’t try to change us in any way, for better or for worse. Our self-equilibrium bases itself upon this foundation, and those who seek to differ from us end up shaking it, thus pushing ourselves even further away from critiques. We become vulnerable by trying to seek stability. Despite thinking we are open-minded towards other, we are in reality extremely closed off from others, unless they share our thoughts.

As a result of this, we learn less about the world. Our horizons remain limited, and we are unable to grow as a person, for growth originates from discomfort, and we can only expand our minds through taking in new ideas, especially those that show our weaknesses. Instead, we only want to hear or be with people who resemble us, making diversity impossible.

Through only listenting to and surrounding ourselves with those who bring us comfort, we only interact with similarities of us, therefore losing the need to improve ourselves.
