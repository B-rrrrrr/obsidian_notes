# Embarrassment through stagnation
It is so common to see many celebrities, especially those who are extremely talented not just famous, appear almost ugly in a way. They have bad posture, talk weird, look unkept, etc. and yet they seem to have almost no shame in that. Instead, they just do their thing and impress. I used to think that this was because they simply stopped caring about what others thought, but it is actually something much more personal than that.

When one experiences embarrassment, that comes not from others but from oneself. The only instance where this emotion can be felt, is when one forms a conscious thought about how they act, look like or in general appear towards others. It also usually occurs even more so when one is not confident with themselves and therefore relies heavily on others opinions of oneself.

These people who do not feel embarrassment don’t because they lack the time to see themselves as is. They are fully absorbed in what they are doing and have stopped to care about what other people happen to think of themselves. The only thing they care about is changing themselves.

This effect is amplified, when the work is greater than oneself. If one is creating and improving oneself constantly, there is no need to be embarrassed about the current state of oneself, because it will pass and transform into something better. Such people are in a constant state of motion and have no time or need to consider themselves at a singular instance.

Those who feel embarrassment feel that because they aren’t changing themselves into something more than what they are.
