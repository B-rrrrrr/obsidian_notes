# To be real rather than seem real
With the invention of the Internet, it seems even more common to want to post things about oneself. People have to say what they’re doing at all times, and if they don’t, it doesn’t even seem like they exist. In fact, with the intense speeds the Internet moves at, it is actually the case that they don’t exist any more in that sense. Others will forget them, and taking this in is hard to swallow. So people keep posting, but is there a way to break this and simply exist without this desire?

To be oneself without acknowledgement is the best state a being can be in. But simply existing is not enough for the self; it requires the need for validation. It has to be recognized in order to feel that it is real and meaningful. Trying to achieve this state becomes even harder through the intense connectivity that is instantiated through the Internet and the constant sharing of the self, thus strengthening this desire to be through others.

However, it still can be achieved through the death of the ego. Once the ego is dead, there is no requirement left for needing to be perceived by others. By transcending the ego of the self, a true and authentic being can emerge that doesn’t base itself off of the thoughts and desires of others, and a person can truly be themselves, even when no one is watching.

Through ego death can a person transcend the need for being constantly seen in order to feel real.
