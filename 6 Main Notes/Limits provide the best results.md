# Limits provide the best results
The reason I feel like Game Jams are such good way of doing game development, is simply because of how much the limitations it brings lets one know exactly where one has to go. The time limit dictates how much effort you need to put in on a daily basis, the theme dictates what you do and the skills I have help dictate how realistic each idea I have is. And it is within these extreme limits that I can thrive. But, as I learned, it seems this is also ideal for life and emotions themselves.

The best works of art come from artists who know their limits and become experts within those limits. It gives them more time to improve themselves in the parts that set them apart from others, and gives them the limitation necessary to get creative inspiration working. Because having an infinite plane to go on, one doesn’t know where to start or where to go.

This also goes for sadness. When a person is ignorant of life, they can be truly happy. They don’t worry about the boundaries of life, since they don’t know that they exist. Ignorance is bliss. But once the boundaries are known and life reveals its true colours, the colours of despair, hopelessness and meaninglessness, then they become sad.

Trying to go beyond the limits of life also doesn’t help. Having hope for a life after death is forcing oneself past the boundaries that define oneself, that let one have the motivation, the necessary inspiration to create life. Going beyond the limits of life does not result in more freedom or motivation, but the opposite. 

Working within limitations results in the best work being done, while being obsessively aware or trying to reach outside them results in despair.
