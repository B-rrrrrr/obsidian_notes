# Narcotics dressed up as art
In culture, tragedy and comedy are profound forms of art. We seek inspiration and feel extreme emotions from these pieces of art. Yet in most cases those who consume this art do not grow through it and instead simulate themselves within it, making them continue to stay the way they are.

Art shows grand emotions and protagonists take transformative journeys that strengthen themselves as characters. However, these pieces of art are viewed by tired average workers, who don’t want art to fundamentally alter them as people the way it transforms the protagonist. Instead, they relax themselves to it and take joy in relishing in the emotions that are felt during the art piece. They do not try and create greatness, but borrow it.

The people who have experienced these great things have a different experience of such art created for relaxation. They see it as pointless and meandering. The desire to simulate such grand spectacles is irrelevant for them, since they have truly experienced them. These true experiences trump any simulation offered by any kind of art. To them, the audience seems to engage in a sick joke and seem to get high off of art. And the culture rewards this kind of pointless art made to be a stimulating narcotic for the purpose of nothing but temporary joy.

Art consumed for comfort and escape only want to have an illusion of transformation without the demanding effort required for it.
