# False appearances of oneself
When I was in primary school, I feared judgement a lot. I didn’t want to show my real self, mostly because I didn’t have a real self to be. My life wasn’t much, which I guess was fine when I was still young but still the fact remains that I was in a way ashamed of myself. For these reasons I decided to hide myself with a mask, a different way of existing. At school and with others, I would act like a clown and try to get everyone to laugh. I wasn’t serious and I didn’t possess that ability. A friend told me that this was the reason he hung out with me. And so I continued this, but I felt more despair than joy in this life.

In order to feel like we exist, we require validation from others. Otherwise, it is like we don’t have any effect on the world. But, if this validation has its origin not from one’s own personal self but rather a fake version, then we exist falsely. We aren’t who we think we are. This disconnect with oneself creates a sense of dread and causes anxiety. What if someone realizes that it’s all a game? Exactly this happens multiple times to Yozo in “No Longer Human” and is one of the sources of his despair.

Eventually, Yozo stops believing that he exists as a human. He feels disqualified, like he doesn’t have the ability to do what others can do. And that is also a reason why he is drawn to those who also feel depressed; he sees his true self within them and feels a kind of validation in that. 

When one creates a fake version of themselves, they receive validation for that fake version, hiding the true self and leading to despair.
