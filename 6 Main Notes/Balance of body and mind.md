# Balance of body and mind
In life, there are usually two types of extremes with regard to where one sets their goals. Either one puts heavy focus on the intellectual aspect of life and therefore has a weak body, but a strong mind, or one puts heavy focus on the body, making one seem strong but is intellectually weak on the inside. Both of these extremes are extremely common and are even stereotyped today, but what if one could combine both?

Mishima was able to do this and wrote about it in Sun and Steel. In it he comments on how having a protruding belly indicates sloth and laziness, whilst displaying ribs and a flat chest shows anxiety or sensitivity. He indicates how people with such bodies, who call themselves intellectuals, preach about grand morals and guidelines to follow, and yet their bodies show no resemblance of these thoughts.

Instead, he thinks that building muscle strengthens this connection between body and mind. Through building muscle one comes into voluntary contact with suffering and death and whilst teetering on this edge of life and death, not only can the body improve and purify itself, but also unite the mind through discipline. No one has ever said that having muscle was a bad thing.

However, he warns that only building muscle is also not good. Both of the extremes are not good to have, and one must strike a balance between the two. Through only having muscle, the body becomes an instrument and one lives like an animal. There are no real thoughts experienced, and life is lived purely on discipline and suffering alone. It is not a complete body that is created in such a case. 

Only through training both the mind and the body equally can a person have a complete, authentic and aesthetic life.
