# Denial
“When I was drunk I wanted to get sober and when I was sober I wanted to get drunk.“  Welcome to Denial. This is the point at which the user doesn’t realize that the thing causing all their problems is the coping mechanism they used to escape from it all. But how can someone escape from Denial if the substance keeps them from the realization and from reality?

Once a substance has been used more than just occasionally then it gradually becomes less effective at its ability to give a high, to make happy, to be fun. This is around the time when the substance has become a routine or a habit and has officially made the user dependent. Generally during these periods the user will also experience what is called Losses. These can be things like losing contact to people, becoming more isolated, getting fired, etc. In order to cope with these things the user turns towards the substance because it has become so ingrained as a coping mechanism of joy. However, this leads to ignoring the hard truth of the situation, because the user always takes the easy way out instead of learning to actually deal with the root of the problem: the substance, which causes the Losses. At this point the user is in Denial.

In order to get out of Denial what’s needed is to gain the self-awareness to confront oneself and to accept reality and the hard truths that come with that. To get there requires a couple of steps though. First of all, the substance must lose its ability to give a high entirely. Once the substance has reached this point the user grows a disdain and hatred towards it. The substance now offers no help in escaping reality which can help make the realization that the substance is the cause of the problems. The final nail in the coffin, if the user still finds themselves in Denial, is the ultimate Loss. Once this occurs the user is forced to confront themselves and realize through the intensity of the emotions through the ultimate Loss and the fact that the substance is unable to provide help, that the substance is at fault for all of it. If the user is able to make this realization then they have defeated Denial and all that is needed to begin the recovery is to get help. 

In order to escape from Denial the substance must lose its ability to console in tough situations.
