# Escaping addiction
Isolation, despair, hopelessness, disappointment: these are all feelings felt by those who try to escape addiction. They know that what they’re doing is bad but they can’t stop, or if they can then they can only hold on for a couple of days before relapsing. No matter what they can’t escape the hold the addiction has on them. But how can you escape?

One method some people take is by making the experience of taking the substance so horrible that they won’t want to come back to it. They kill of the Disease by excess. Unfortunately this method usually doesn’t work for the simple reason that the Ultimate Loss is only a way to get out of Denial not the addiction itself. For recovery there is something else that must be done:

You have to do what people tell you to do. Getting help from others is one of the most important steps in recovery because in isolation you depend yourself on your own personal will. This will that has ceased to be your own and is instead controlled by the Disease. You cannot trust in yourself to get you out because what you think will try and get you back in. And when it comes to doing what you’re told to do you have to eliminate your own thoughts and beliefs about your actions, you just have to do them.

In order to get to this position though you have to want to do what you’re told. If you don’t want to do the things others tell you to do to help in the recovery process that means that your own personal will is still in control. And if this happens then you’ll find yourself back in the arms of the Disease.

By eliminating personal will and wanting to follow the guidance from others, addiction can be beaten.
