# Dangers of immortalization
The flesh is merely one form of existence. It is possible for people to transcend this limit and live on long after the process of decay. Authors of bygone times, composers whose works are still played hundreds of years after their death, memories of dead people live on inside those who remember them, and in more recent times the internet has become a home for all thoughts and expressions; how many of those people are still alive today?

Thus, a person becomes immortalized. This state is one that many desire and leads to wanting to not live in the real world any more, but rather in a future one. Existing with the people of the now loses its importance, and the only thing that matters is ensuring one's own immortality through the creation of as much work as possible. These people eventually become detached to the real world; they lose intimacy, relationships and meaning. Finally, this desire can lead to a sense of utter despair and suicide.

However, this shouldn’t be something to desire. Instead, creating meaning for the present life and finding true happiness does not come from trying to immortalize oneself, but rather through changing the lives of others in the now. The present and fleeting moments of today are the only ones that truly matter in a person's life, not the future ones.

The desire to transcend the flesh and immortalize oneself is strong, but true existence and meaning comes from living in the present moment with others.
