# Continue rather than return for knowledge
It seems that there are many cases of people who criticize consciousness. They think that it is an evolutionary mishap and that it is a curse. They long to become the animals who know not and long for simplicity. But this is simply impossible, and one must live with the knowledge that we have now. This thought process remains true when creating one’s own values and finding hardship with the realizations that one makes about life.

We feel like we can experience true freedom once we break free from traditional values and morals. Society can no longer limit us, and we have the possibility to form one’s own values and create new meaning that is relevant for us and the way we want to live. This discovery is joyful at first and is rewarding. We tell ourselves we would never want to return to society and their restraints.

But over time, this freedom begins to show its true form. Namely, we still are bound by the limits that we set ourselves. Despite stepping into the infinite plains of the unknown, we still must centre ourselves around something in order to create our own values. Thus, we remain constrained by our own values.

Therefore, we may experience further despair and long to go back to simpler times, back to when we were an ignorant member of society. This homesickness plagues us, but it is impossible to return. The knowledge that has been gained cannot be revoked. Instead, one must continue setting sail into the unknown and create one’s own values to find happiness and joy in life and reject the despair that may follow.

Once one abandons traditional values and creates their own, they cannot return to their original knowledge and must through hardship keep going on their journey through the unknown.
