# Using politeness as a mask
There are quite a few people I’ve encountered in my life who have this constant and almost annoying kind of humbleness or politeness towards others. They never seem to take a stance, nor do they have anything positive to say about themselves. They always form thoughts and opinions about everything, including themselves, from other people. But why do they do this?

Such people are unsure about their own position and always come to fear the worst. Whenever someone comments about themselves, they anticipate negativity from that person and try to either play themselves off (seeming humble) or move to talk about the other person. They lack confidence within themselves and cannot accept anything given to them.

So everything they do becomes a mask against others. Their politeness becomes a defensive strategy in order to eliminate all possibilities of being met with criticism or negativity. Their kindness is not created out of a need to be kind, but is forced out of the person.

They see every person or event that occurs as something to damage them. Their worldview is tormented by fear and each interaction is a chance to harm them, and so they react reactively rather than proactively engaging with the situation. 

People not confident within themselves put up a mask of politeness to avoid any negativity directed towards themselves.
