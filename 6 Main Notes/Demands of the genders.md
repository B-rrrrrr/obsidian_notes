# Demands of the genders
When it comes to love between two people, both have to have separate demands. It is impossible to have proper and fulfilling love when both demand the same rights.

Usually it is the woman who wants the complete surrender of her partner. The partner has to leave soul, body and mind for this love, this belief of love. For this woman, love is the ultimate faith. The goal of such a person is not selfishness though, but it is rather to enrich their partner's life through being possessed and offering their qualities to them.

This makes the logical conclusion that the partner, the man, cannot have the same demand. It is impossible for both parties to want sacrifice, because there would be nothing left. One puzzle piece needs to connect, they cannot both have an empty spot. Thus, the partner has to be someone who wants to take another, to let them fulfil themselves even more as a result. 

However, doesn’t the need for possession end with the possession? This is usually the case, but here it can be quite the opposite. When the taker loves a person so much, they don’t want to believe that their partner has nothing left to give them. They believe that their partner is so great, that they are a bottomless pit of joy and fulfilment of different aspects that they can possess, and thus the love intensifies.
