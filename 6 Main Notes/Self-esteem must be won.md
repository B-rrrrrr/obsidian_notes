# Self-esteem must be won
I’ve struggled a lot with self-esteem, going from feeling like I have a lot to realizing that my self-worth was based on an appearance and then drowning in despair and little self-esteem. From there, I’ve slowly built up my confidence again, though I still experience imposter syndrome frequently. So, how does self-esteem develop itself?

Self-esteem can be got blindly. There are many people who have a blunt and simplified confidence in themselves. They do not develop their self-worth, but rather have just got it, either through their upbringing or through their interpretations of other people. They haven’t looked within themselves to see that they actually have no self-worth, but are dependent on others.

Thus, once the realization hits they lose their self-worth. They doubt themselves in everything they do and want to do. Despair hits them like a truck and they grow a sceptic within them. Imposter syndrome strikes and anything they do seems worthless to themselves.

Here is where self-esteem must be earned. It is about showing the sceptic, that one actually deserves a higher sense of self. Through every achievement earned, they slowly begin convincing themselves that they have actual value and can slowly begin to have confidence within themselves. But this journey never ends. There will always be a sceptic within them that judges them, and it is through this dissatisfaction that greatness can be aspired toward.

Through self-doubt and dissatisfaction with oneself, one slowly builds up confidence and self-worth through proof such as achievements.
