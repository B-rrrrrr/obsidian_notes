# Quantity of life in the present
How is it possible that a person can improve if they never experience all different aspects of a life? To put it more clearly, how can a person truly know if what they are doing is a good aspect of their lives if they have never experienced anything else? And how can one distinguish between different ways of living?

Society and in past times the Church puts an immense pressure on living as good of a life as possible now in order to improve the future in some way. They suggest that one can achieve this through living a simple, high quality kind of life, with one goal or purpose in mind that one fulfils. In other words, quality over quantity.

But, this kind of thinking is limiting to a person. They live in hopes of the future and never truly live in the present. They hope to be remembered, to have done enough to help others further on, but what about the people today, the people one can actually truly influence? Here it is clearly better to live at the moment, not in hopes of the future.

And to achieve this kind of freedom as well, living a singular life is simply impossible. Being confined to one way of being is limiting. Instead, it should be better to have lived numerous diverse lives, to exist and to think in as many different ways as possible. It is what makes life a thing that one can adapt to and can truly enjoy the unique moment of each second that life brings. 

Quantity of life is more important than quality of life.
