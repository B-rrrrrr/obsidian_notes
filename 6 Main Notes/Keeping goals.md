# Keeping goals
When I started running there was no problem for me to go on a run. It was simply a thing I did and a thing that would eventually lead me to participate (and hopefully) complete my very first marathon. However, after a couple of weeks of running daily and exerting my body continuously, I came to a realization: I will have to go through this suffering for as long as I deem it worthy, which at that time was seemingly my whole life. I started panicking and my brain tripped itself up through a series of thoughts. How could I even believe that my mind and body would be capable of such an intense feat? How would I convince myself to wake up and run after so many successful repetitions? Wouldn’t my brain tell me that I can afford to skip a run once because I’ve been so successful?

In Infinite Jest these thoughts are expressed by an addict and a group of kids playing tennis at an academy. When hearing professionals talk about how they got to their respective position, the amount of time and effort they’ve spent seems immense. However, these sentiments can also be felt by anyone attempting to achieve long-term goals or committing to a hobby. 

Infinite Jest has a solution to these problems: Don’t count the days. This singular thought pattern is able to solve all of these worries, because it simultaneously stops you from thinking about the future and the past. All the days that you were successful do not pressure you for this current moment. Nor do the successful times in the past let you be lazy in the present. All the future times you have to be successful do not pressure you for this current moment. Only the thing you do now matters, and isn’t that an easy thought? Just do this now and then forget about it. 

This works incredibly for me and also for the addicts living in Infinite Jest, especially when Don Gately is hospitalized and must deny useful but addictive pain killers when every thought he has is “You’ve done good so far, what’s the harm in relapsing just once?”

When achieving a long-term goal appears daunting to yourself remember: *Don’t count the days.* Live in the present. The past and the future do not influence you now.
