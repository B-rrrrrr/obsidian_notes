# Voluntary distance from comfort for joy
There have been many times when I’ve had friendships that’ve died out. However, the main reason for them, is not because of too much distance, but rather through too much connection. Despite us having so much joy being in each other's company, it gets too much for the two of us, and we grow tired of each other. Thus, distance is sought, and sometimes we reunite and these cases of reunion are wonderful. But eventually, no more renunciations happen, and it fully dies out. But, as Nietzsche says, these distances should not be caused naturally, but done purposefully to keep the world and life fresh.

When spending time with something or someone, they can slowly transform themselves into being yet another thing in life. They become average, unlike at the first meeting when something special drew them closer. But time erodes this uniqueness, no matter how unique or important they are.

One can say that discipline should be used to keep them close. Just by pushing through can one keep it close to oneself and stop the automatic distancing that occurs, but this can only be a temporary solution. Eventually, discipline will fail and the distancing will occur regardless.

But this distancing should be embraced. Moving away from someone or something is not an act of deprivation nor is it bad. Instead, it should be consistently encouraged. By voluntarily letting oneself disengage from the things that bring us joy and happiness can one then reunite with them with a new and more profound sense of joy, just like on the first discovery.

Voluntarily disengaging with the things that bring us comfort will reawaken the joy of the first discovery of them when reuniting.
