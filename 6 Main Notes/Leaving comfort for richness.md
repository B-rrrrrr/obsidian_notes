# Leaving comfort for richness
Isn’t it weird how once most people finally become what they aspired to be, they realize that they aren’t really truly happy? They do all this work just to realize it’s fairly average. And then they start looking around for things to find fulfilment and joy in, stuff that other people have told them worked and therefore surely trustworthy, no? But, it is within this comfort zone that one is in, and through these thoughts of other people that one must overcome to find joy.

People usually do not command themselves. They like to be led by others who seem to know more or are inspirations for them. Trying to become like them makes sense; they are successful in some way, so if I am like them, then I am successful. Even if one reaches such a position, one will find no real great sense of fulfilment there.

Thus, they look for a greater sense of joy. Except, they search for it within their own confines. They search for fulfilment from within the things they are supposed to overcome. They look towards their own already formed and treat their comfort zone as the only place to be. 

Instead, for true fulfilment, one must go beyond the borders that one has. Disagree with thoughts, venture out into unknown lands, try out new things, etc. Eventually, one will find staying in one place boring and the knowledge of the unknown will drive one on to experience more and more things for a truly unique and wonderous life.

For a great richness in life, one must go beyond the borders of oneself and outside the limits that others create.
