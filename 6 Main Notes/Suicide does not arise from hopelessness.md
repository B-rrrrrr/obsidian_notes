# Suicide does not arise from hopelessness

A person is trapped within a burning building and finds themselves stuck on the third floor. The flames have entrenched the entire place and smoke clouds the rooms. This person has only one route of escape: jump out of the window. They try to delay this for as long as possible because jumping out is almost certain death. Maybe help will arrive eventually? People outside scream for them to not do it for help is on the way but the flames… the flames are too hot to bear. They open up the window and jump.

This is an equivalent given from Kate Gompert in Infinite Jest to how she experiences the pain of living and why people attempt to commit suicide. For her depression has eaten her up so much, that instead of just being a numb empty feeling, it’s turned into a divine anguish that torments her everyday. She feels there is no escape from it and thus turns to suicide, trying to find relief from the flames.

People looking at those who are psychotically depressed do not understand the inner torment they suffer and believe that these people can just get better if they get help. They don’t realize that suicide is the better of the two evils for these people and that they don’t want to die but rather feel they have to. In order for outsiders to understand this pain, they’d have to have experienced it themselves.

For those suffering from this psychotic depression, feeling nothing is utter bliss. Even though most people see this as depression, for people suffering such anguish, a lack of feeling is better than feeling a constant and relentless despair.

Those who commit suicide do not do so out of hopelessness, but rather because not living is the last attempt to try and save themselves from the inner torment they experience.
