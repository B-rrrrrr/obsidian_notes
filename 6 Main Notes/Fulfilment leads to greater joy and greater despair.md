# Fulfilment leads to greater joy and greater despair
Those with a more developed inner life go into deeper waters for fulfilment and can fall under the waves. Those who don’t tread into deep water cannot even comprehend such depths.

As life goes on and one discovers more and more unique ideas that influence the way of living, one’s personal fulfilment in life increases as well. One feels more free, more open, and more knowing of that which comes. However, one is also susceptible to greater pitfalls: contradictions, a growing sense of hopelessness, incredible realizations about reality that lead to utter despair, etc. In such cases, fulfilment leads to greater sufferings, in contrast to those who haven’t tried to develop themselves. Such people do not go and find greater meanings of their lives and thus cannot even experience such intense pitfalls. They wouldn’t be able to comprehend the despair that is experienced by those who’ve lived more.
