# Forming ourselves to our ideals
We all have an ideal form of ourselves in mind that we aspire towards. A perfect individual who does all the things that we respect. But, striving for this ideal with the wrong basis or even having a wrong ideal will result in not being able to be sustained and an eventual collapse of the self. By that it is meant that the ideal is able to be achieved, but it results in resentment, guilt, contradictory thoughts and values, and creates tension within oneself.

Creating a good ideal requires one to have a strong foundation. In other words, the deepest drives that a person has must already align to the ideal. By going against this, what happens is that the ideal cannot be sustained for longer periods of time. One goes against the grain of their subconscious and making the ideal an impossibility. Before shaping the self, one must understand their true nature from within.

But, the ideal itself can also be flawed. When taking values or even entire ideals from others without thinking about oneself, the ideal itself becomes contradictory to oneself, to one’s true nature or even one’s own values. Our nature should not try to be like someone else’s nature, because it also becomes an unsustainable ideal.

Therefore, when forming one’s own ideal, one must learn one’s own nature and understand one’s deepest drives in order to create an idea that corresponds to that nature.
