# Morality is not individuality
“Moralität ist Herden-Instinkt im einzelnen.”

Morals almost always come not from the individual, but from the thoughts and ideals of society. Values and priorities originate from this herd instinct, and through them the individual is forced to act upon or risk being abandoned. When acting upon these instincts, they do not act upon individual ideas, but social pressure. The value that one feels is based upon these ideals of others, and by acting by their values, one's own value feels confirmed.

However, there are sometimes differences in values. This lies behind different kinds of society. Either way, through engaging with others, their ideals will be pressed upon oneself and be made to agree with. Don’t, and once again the risk of social rejection is imminent and the fear of being left alone with oneself repeats once again.

Deviating from these ideals that are conditioned within the self is uncomfortable. By doing this, one risks not personal judgement, even though it feels like that, but rather societal judgement. Such a person is going against the grain and risks rejection and fear of abandonment. But for the formation of own values, this limitation must be overcome. Otherwise, one is like all others and only feels validation, if they act though the ways of others, rather than being an individual.

Morality is acting with the thoughts and ideas of others, even when they are not there, which limits the creation of own ideas.
