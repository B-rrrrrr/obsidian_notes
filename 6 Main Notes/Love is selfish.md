# Love is selfish
The definition of selfishness could very well have arisen from the concept of love, despite our society seeing love as the most selfless thing one can do. 

When a person loves somebody, this person of course wants their partner to love them back. It is a simple fact. But, in order to make sure that their partner indeed loves them back, they have to control this person, so that they become the highest priority in the lives of their partner. 

Every person has a unique personality, has different desires and lives in a completely different way in general. Love wants to decimate this world and turn it colourless, a world governed by the partner to fit their demands. They must be the only thing their partner loves and even though they love this person, they seem to not care about their lover’s life. 

But, there does indeed lie a kind of love that goes past this intense narcissism. A love that doesn’t depend on the singular, overarching, unrelenting love from the other and a love that leaves the person’s world unique to them. This kind of love originates from the respect of the other person for who they are and what they do. This love is called friendship.

Love between the two genders is an inherently selfish act, with a desire from the one to be the highest desire of the other. Only the love from friendship is an act of true love that builds itself off of the other’s uniqueness.
