# Bad images not bad people
Society likes to create stereotypes of people. Women have to be obedient, men must be commanding, programmers always look like nerds, jacked men are stupid, etc. When fitted into these boxes, they are in a way rewarded for them, unless the image is seen as bad. Then the people are seen in a negative light. If they then break free of them though, it is seen as damaging and strange. Thus, a negative cycle is created that they can’t escape from. But there is a way to escape it: through the image itself.

We create images of how someone should be. When a person then either willingly or not becomes infatuated with that image, then they must adhere to it. If they don’t, there is an immense backlash that society whips them with. In order to see themselves as an existing and real person and to reap the rewards that society gives them, they must become their appearance.

There are times though when this appearance is seen as negative. Women are seen to be too flirty, and they corrupt the men, men who are tough and stupid need to educate themselves, otherwise they will never live or get a proper girlfriend, etc. It is not the people that need to change, as it is believed by others. These people have only moulded themselves in the way that actually gives them acknowledgment from others. They themselves are not at fault for being bad, instead it is the appearance itself that is negative. Therefore, for proper change, those who created the views need to change, for they created the negative image in the first place. The creators of the image are the ones responsible, not the imitators.

We create images that everyone needs to mould themselves by. If a group is seen as negative though, it is not the group that needs to change for the better, but the image and therefore the creators of the image.
