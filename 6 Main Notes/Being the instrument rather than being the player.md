# Being the instrument rather than being the player
In society, being a selfless person is praised and is called a noble thing to want to do. However, this desire to be selfless can make the actual self worse. By helping others, one loses one’s own art to create and becomes a hollow being if one cannot find another being to infuse themselves with.

Many people would rather become instruments used by others than become a self-serving and self-creating being. Instead of becoming a thinker or professor, one becomes their assistant on the side. In other words, a tool or a function of the other. Almost always, this tool is a much more watered down version of the person they are being beneficial of, despite them aspiring to be the person to want to be. 

By doing this, one’s own will and value is diminished. Their will is weak and doesn’t have the power to want to develop into the person they are being used by. Such a person becomes a servant of another, and instead of having the ability and freedom to develop themselves free from restraint, they are kept in reign by the person using them as a tool. They cannot create their own values and are given to them by others.

Desiring to be such a tool by others makes the self hollow, and it is unable to stand alone. Only by being useful can the self feel that it is worth existing; if it cannot create its own values for purpose, the other must give it values and give it worth. If this does not happen, then the self disintegrates and the person becomes an empty shell of a human being, with no desire or purpose left to exist.

Being selfless in the way that one becomes used by another, eliminates the art of creating and forces such a person to adhere to others to find meaning and use in existence.
