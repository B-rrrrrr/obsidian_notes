# Why do we become addicted?
When it was announced that there existed a film that was so enjoyable that anyone who watched it would lose the will to eat, drink or even live in order to watch the film, most people ignored it. Except at some point almost everyone will decide to sit down and watch it and then die from it. But why would a person willingly sit down with such a thing and basically kill themselves by engaging with the ultimate pleasure?

This is the scene set in the book Infinite Jest and asks why a person would decide to watch such a film. Surely no one would watch it? But exactly this is not the case because every single person in this world will eventually struggle with addiction at some point, and then
be tempted to watch the movie and thus become an addict. But, replacing the movie for more average substances, how would it differ from someone merely having fun with it once in a while to an addict who uses it constantly?

The reason for this is the same reason why someone would decide to engage with the substance in the first place: in order to disengage with the self. The easiest way to escape the painful reality of living and to escape uncomfortable situations is to block them out through the use of addictive substances. Whether that be video games, weed, heroin or an entertainment that is so addictive that you donâ€™t want to anything else but watch it (Infinite Jest), they are used for the purpose of eliminating the self, either temporarily or permanently. 

Those who seek to destroy the self permanently are those who have become addicted. By using the substance constantly and turning to it at all times, the true self becomes hidden underneath the layer of the pleasure that the substance gives. 

Addicts are formed out of the desire to eliminate the uncomfortable truth within the self in order to destroy it, permanently.
