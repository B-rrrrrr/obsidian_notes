# Belief comes from weak wills
Religion, nationalism, and even pessimism all try and stabilize the weaker parts of the self. When one feels unstable in life and doesn’t know how to approach it any more, belief systems help find stability again. Religion tells one what to do, and following a belief feels like the right thing to do in a society. One can connect with others and find a purpose in life. 

Thus, belief originates from the need for stability. In other words, if one cannot command themselves, they need to be commanded from something or somebody else. Whether that is a God, a master, a teacher, or something else doesn’t matter. Through this, even the weak can get a stronger will. However, by following such a belief, one loses one’s own sense of freedom and own will. Instead of being oneself, one acts according to the belief, with or without agreement. 

Feeling the need to believe in something comes from the need to find stability and guidance, since one doesn’t have their own will to follow.
