# Strength will destroy
Say you go to a gym for the first time. In the gym you see plenty of people of different levels of strength, but in the middle of the gym there is one man who seems to have lived in the gym his whole life and is bench pressing more kilograms than that fat dude on the treadmill weighs. This strong man motivates you to want to achieve his strength, but that motivation ends up being your downfall, and you tear a muscle that same day trying too hard. That strong man as well ends up injured after doing 10 reps of that weight. But the saying that strength destroys is not only for physical strength, but also for mental.

When a person finally overcomes a majority of their shortcomings, they become stronger. This strength creates a desire to continue to persevere against the weaknesses and shortcomings of the self. Due to the strength they have, however, they become merciless towards their weaknesses. Only perfection can satisfy the overwhelming need to become stronger, and thus they constantly push themselves, which can lead to overcoming these weaknesses, but will eventually result in an irreparable self-destruction, precisely because of their shortcomings.

Likewise, weaker people will also be crushed by the strength. Strong people will radiate their strength to those around them, and weaker people will look up to them and also, like the strong ones eventually do, will collapse by the weight of their greatness. Weaker people are not going to be ready for the will required to reach the same level, and so will end up doing poor imitations of that greatness and stumble around on uncertain paths. Then there are also some, who will be entirely deterred by the greatness and fall into a kind of hopelessness against achieving it, and then will never grow themselves as a person to even try and reach it.

Witnessing or having strength can both build a person up, but also bring a person down, through self-destruction, which will either be reparable or irreparable.
