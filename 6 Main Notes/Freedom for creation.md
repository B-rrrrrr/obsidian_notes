# Freedom for creation
At what point can one call themselves truly free in what they do? According to Nietzsche, it is once a person finally becomes shameless of oneself. 

By not being ashamed of oneself, one breaks free from herd thinking. No longer does it matter what others think, since there is nothing that one has to hide or feel ashamed of. One can therefore do whatever one likes without fear of judgement or need of validation.

On top of that, one is free from the constraints of societies values. No longer does one feel the need to appeal to values from the outside world in order to feel good, since by not being ashamed of oneself, one can create own values that mean something for them.

Thus, a person becomes completely self-serving by this line of thinking. The only thing that matters to such a person, is to become the best version of themselves, accepting failure as a necessary progression and the always expanding goal as motivation and determination for progression. A person is completely free to do whatever they want to, and however they want to.

Freedom to do whatever one wants comes from eliminating the ego and not being ashamed of oneself.
