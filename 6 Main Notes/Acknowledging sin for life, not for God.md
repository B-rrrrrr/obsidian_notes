# Acknowledging sin for life, not for God
The reason we know about sin and think that is is bad, is because of religion. Without it, believing in different Gods would not be something to be ashamed of. And with the advent of disbelief in God, these thoughts about sin should be discarded. But how can we do that?

We feel shame for our sin, because our society has become infused with the thoughts of Christian religion. The bible declares all our wrong-doings, and by feeling ashamed and asking for forgiveness can we gain God’s mercy. Except, all of these sins do not affect mankind. Instead, priests say that our sins affect the honour of God; we cannot enter heaven with sin. There is thus a divide between ourselves and God, making us slaves to him, except this slavery is caused by ourselves.

However, the Greeks thought differently about such sin. They saw transgression not as something that harmed the Gods. Instead, a display of excess or of morally bad things for them show the human condition. It is not an offence against God, but a sign of being a human being, a sign that should exist and be displayed in art like tragedy. 

Therefore, we should learn to think of sin or rather transgression not as something to be ashamed of, but something that reflects the human condition. It is what gives life its fullness and its drama, and without it, we would be slaves to some omniscient creature commanding us to be less than what we are.

If God is dead, then transgression should not shame us any more.
