# Being able to critique
Being able to take criticism is already seen as high class in our society. Not letting oneself’s ego be destroyed by others is already an accomplishment within itself.

But being willing to take criticism or even to seek it out is even better. Understanding that one has a limited point of view and wishes to find improvement is an even rarer sight to see and shows a sense of self that not many have.

Finally, the most important of all is those who give criticism. Those who understand themselves the best and have gone through a wide range of transformation and are now willing to give tips to others are the ultimate peak of self.
