# Our surroundings reveal our drives
For a long time I told myself I was a game developer without making much. All of my games were unfinished prototypes and just in general bad copies of various tutorials. Looking at the way I spent my time throughout the day, it was almost completely spent on distractions, such as YouTube, video games or other random things that didn’t help me achieve my actual goals. Despite this, I claimed to be a developer, but my environment revealed my actual being: a consumer.

People can claim to be striving for something in life, whether that be adventure, creativity, love, etc. but their environment will truly reveal what they are actually striving for. If one merely says that they seek a purpose and end up surrounding themselves with comfort and distractions, then their true desires are revealed. Namely, they are not seeking an overarching goal to transform themselves, instead they conform to their temptations and remain stuck. It is through this realization that shows whether one is truly achieving a desire they want to achieve, since our surroundings emerge from our true will and purpose.

Our surroundings brutally reveal how honest we are about our aims.
