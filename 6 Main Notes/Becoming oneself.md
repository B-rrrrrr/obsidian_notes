# Becoming oneself
My identity online is different from the one in the real world. Likewise, the way I act to my parents is quite different to the way I act in school or with my colleagues. Hell, even the way I act between my friends is different depending on the person. But who am I, in that case? The sum of all these parts? Or an independent being, separated from all of them into one unique identity only known to my subconscious?

We do not live alone in the world. Other people exist, who perceive us and therefore make us feel real. The reason why many people feel lonely despite being in a crowd is precisely because the crowd does not acknowledge their existence. This leads to the thought that a person only exists, because other people think that that person exists.

With this knowledge, the sense of self becomes not a singular thing. People can have differing thoughts about the exact same thing, and putting this through to the perception of a human being, they can see them different to others. Or rather, that person can present themselves differently to others. If a person only shows a certain aspect of themselves, how can another person know of the other aspects of that person? Thus, identities are created.

But what makes the self, then? Is it the collective thought of all people in the world and the identities that a person shares with them? But then that person would slowly die out after people forget them, or the people die themselves. One’s sense of self becomes linked with others and their perception. Such a person does not have a self, but multiple, differing ones that may even contradict each other.

Instead, I think that one must ground themselves not with the way others think of oneself, but by the way that one acts. A person cannot split themselves into different identities and hope to know who they are. They must act, regardless of who is watching, exactly as they want to, not in the fear of the perception of others. 

We exist because others see us, but we can only become ourselves through independant action.
