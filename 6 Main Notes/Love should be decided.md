# Love should be decided
We all worship that which we love. Whether that be a nation, friend, lover, object, job or something else, these things will make us who we are. Because what you worship decides all other decisions, virtues and morals that you have. But how should we choose what to worship? Can we even choose? And how does what I love, change my self?

When you choose to do something, what your values are is dependent on what you value in life. What you value is exactly what you worship. Of course, there are better and worse things to love. For example, by choosing to worship a person, your self will be on unstable ground. By loving this person, you are dependent on their wellbeing. This person can leave, lie, go mad, betray you, die, and yet in a such a case your decisions, virtues and values will be based upon this unsteady foundation. It is better to worship something that is greater than the self, something that enlarges the heart, something that won’t change so suddenly.

But you can’t always choose what you worship, no? Sometimes the love for something just becomes. Sometimes you can’t choose whether to love or not, and in such a case the love just exists. However, in this case your foundation is not built on instability, but rather on nothing. For in this scenario, what you worship becomes what you desire. In other words, you worship your sentiments and your self. You become a slave to yourself, but believe you are free. Since your foundation is nonexistent, you will fall, and find yourself at rock bottom.

Choose with great care what you decide to love, because it is what informs your every decision, virtue and value. If you don’t choose and instead follow your heart, you become a slave to your own desires.
