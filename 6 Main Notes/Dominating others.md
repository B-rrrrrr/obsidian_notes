# Ruling others
I can fix her. The obvious answer to this is, you can’t. But why?

When someone cannot rule themselves, they seem lesser than someone who can. This logic leads to the belief of being able to rule over such a person, since they can’t do it themselves. But, this person who lacks inner discipline cannot be easily controlled. They will act in chaotic ways and require more support by their master. 

This required support turns the self-ruling master into a person having to meet the needs of the person they control, which in turn makes them more of a slave than the other. They are ruled by the others disorder. This leads to the other person not being able to be put in a position to improve themselves, and instead just lets them be who they are as they are taken care of by their “master”. 

A person who cannot govern themselves, cannot be governed by others and makes those who try slaves to the others.
