# Taking thoughts from others
There is a kind of irony in the following passage, namely, taking the thoughts of other philosophers and utilizing them as is. For the longest time, all I’ve done is just read thoughts from people much smarter than me and accepted it as truth. However, by just taking the ideas and utilizing them in my self rather than thinking about them and critically evaluating them, I take the ideas as truth and thus incorporate a lot of conflicts with “my” philosophies. This agreeing comes from not having the courage, strength, will, intelligence to see the ideas for what they are and to disagree, to challenge, and to change them based on my views. This is especially the case for hypocritical thoughts that I’ve just taken to heart, things like Ayn Rand’s views on individualism and then also moral values from society about helping others. I’m not following either of them fully, I pick and choose based on what I want and what fits the moment appropriately. I am not becoming a unique person. Instead, I become a middle ground of all the thoughts and become a mishmash of all the different ideas into one amalgamation of bile.

Those who merely take ideas and do not disagree, challenge, or change them are weak-minded individuals who merely borrow thoughts, letting hypocrisy and selflessness dictate their lives.
