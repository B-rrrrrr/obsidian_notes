# Two kinds of suffering
I’ve always found it strange how people can interpret Nietzsche in two very different ways: a person who is a nihilist and a person who wants the most out of life. Those are two very different stances and yext it is possible for both to be correct. But how? 

There are two kinds of suffering in life, having an overflow of it or having a lack of it.

Those who have an overflow of life accept every emotion and experience that comes to them equally, leading to them experiencing great pain but also great joy whereas those who have a lack of life need to find their joy outside of life itself. This can be through things like a God or perhaps logic, where one can find stability and trust in life.

Both of these arts of suffering can create the will to create and to transform oneself, however, the reason for the creation differs tremendously. One must ask, am I creating because I experience too much or too little? Thus, creation can be the result of the need for perpetuation, destruction, finding the new, looking at the future and other things.

But all these different reasons for creation can originate in both kinds of suffering. When it comes to perpetuation, for example, both the person with an overflow of life and a lack of life will find it useful. The former for thankfulness and for love, the latter for an act of revenge against everyone and everything to come. Therefore, there remains a link between pessimism and the overflow of life. One could name it Dionysian pessimism.

Through suffering, one can create reasons for creation and for living, but the reasons will differ.
