# Our subconscious reveals ourselves
For the longest time, conscious thinking has been thought to be the best way of thinking. Emotions and actions act by themselves within the subconscious and therefore happen without thought. Thus, by doing conscious thinking we can amass proper understanding of ourselves and others and need to see our emotions not as dictators but as things to be explained.

However, these conscious thoughts merely take the compromise of our feelings. Only after experiencing something and relating it to the actions and sentiments we felt, can we commence conscious and analytical thought. Conscious thought then becomes just a weak interpretation of the events that happened within us. 

In accordance, conscious thinking causes immense fatigue to the thinker. They are constantly analysing, comparing, contrasting... They are trying to find the immense thought that has caused them to be the way they are, and can only find mild, somewhat relevant thoughts or maybe not even that but blatant lies or half-truths of oneself.

No, it is truly that which happens within us that has the most insight. Conscious thought is a filter for the ideas we truly have within us. But in order to experience these true feelings, we must let the subconscious do its work.
