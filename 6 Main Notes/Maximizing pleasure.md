# Maximizing pleasure
In life we want to maximize pleasure and minimize suffering for ourselves. We want people to adhere to us, to respect us and to serve us. In other words we want domesticated pets as friends, lovers and colleagues. But this is not a healthy society and it is not a society that can exist, because if everyone has this goal then no one can have this goal. So, how can two people achieve maximal pleasure even though such a thing is impossible?

First of all, those who derive pleasure from the suffering of others are excluded from this discussion, as suffering should always be minimized. The exclusion also happens in real life; take prisons for example. But for all the other cases, where in order for me to maximize pleasure I must take away an opportunity for you to experience pleasure, what happens?

Some say that simply acknowledging that one is not alone in desiring pleasure should be enough. While this does make the individual less self-centered it doesn’t solve the dilemma. For this we must turn to a process called delayed gratification. By knowing that one can decide to not partake in the immediate effects of pleasure but to wait for these rewards to come later, we can experience a greater pleasure while respecting the other person. In Infinite Jest there is an example of being unable to share a soup and that the other person must leave and buy another soup. The one who decides to delay the pleasure of eating the soup will not only get to enjoy a soup that they’ve bought but also relish in the pleasure of letting someone else take priority and know that this person values them in return.

This system isn’t perfect though. There is still greed, jealousy, crime, etc. and the only way of learning to delay this gratification is by simply becoming a mature adult and learning to prioritize others. This process cannot be forced unto someone.

Maximizing pleasure of a society can only be done through recognizing the wishes of others and sacrificing your own temporary pleasure for a better and more long-term pleasure.
