# Wanting to suffer
We live in a culture where the value of life seems negative. Life is filled with suffering and torment and in order to live life without this pain, we need a specific cure. Something to fix life itself. Since this belief is so engrained within us, we tend to exaggerate the suffering we experience. Mild inconveniences turn into overblown “depressions” and people almost believe it were better to be suffering than to be happy. Those who are happy are seen as liars and who see life through a fabricated and childish lens. The “nihilists” created from this kind of life feel validated through seeing life as a serious and painful experience, and find justification of their belief from society.

In actuality, life and humans already have the cure for these painful moments. These are small things like hope, distraction, pride, meaning, etc. that act successfully against pain. In extreme cases, we can also rid of extreme pain by disabling ourselves, in the same way a feverish person faints. 

Plus, all pain eventually leads to new-found strength. A person might be sad for a bit, but find themselves strengthened and transformed from the pain after it has accrued. And yet there remains that intense belief that pain still needs to exist even after one has recovered from it, making a person force themselves into believing that they are suffering from nothing. Life then seems more painful than it actually is.

In the end, the solution proposed for this painful life is stoicism. By numbing all emotion and becoming human stones with an indifference to all, we can eliminate pain. But happiness cannot and will not emerge from this kind of stoicism. Instead, we need to see that life is not pure suffering, and it is not a problem to be fixed. Pain is a part of life and with it, we gain new strength to continue on living. For this, we don’t need to become numb to emotions, but instead to amplify our emotions and live life as it comes to us, pain or pleasure.

Since life is seen as a painful experience that requires a cure, humanity interprets it as such and therefore exaggerates their feeling to appeal to that interpretation.
