# Life is an experience, not a goal
People have great expectations for life, or even others have these expectations for others. Life should have an ultimate goal, a purpose for which one lives for. And not fulfilling this goal or not amounting to what one or to what others are is seen as a failure. Or even, if life itself is so cruel to oneself, then life has become a disappointment for oneself. But, these thoughts about life are flawed and confining. There is a better way of thinking about life.

Namely, life is something to be experienced. Life itself has no goal or meaning, nor should one really be given. Doing this causes life to be confined to that meaning, making things that happen within that life either beneficial or not to achieving that goal. Instead, one should develop the thought that life is as life is: an experience. This thought liberates oneself immensely and lets each event of life exist and be interpreted individually.

Speaking of, life in this way becomes a means of obtaining knowledge. Once life loses its meaning and becomes an experience, values and morals also fall away. This means that things that society demands become useless to oneself, making the experiences of life dictate what one actually needs.

Through seeing life not as a duty or a punishment, one can be liberated from the confinements of a certain way of living by letting life be experienced as it comes.
