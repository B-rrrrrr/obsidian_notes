# Suicide comes from reasoning
Both the person who keeps on living and the person who has killed themselves do so out of the same realization; the one accepting it while the other refuses it.

The main reason that someone kills themselves, is because they believe that life is not worth living any more. This inherently means that for these people, life requires a sense of purpose or need to be worth it. This also reigns true for those who kill themselves for a noble purpose like that of martyrs or suicide as a protest: They commit suicide to find a purpose in life and to make it worth it.

Despite this, suicide is not the result of a singular thought, but rather a development of searching for this worth in life. This search for meaning is pointless, since the universe has none, and then they come to the conclusion that life bases itself on habit. Seeing this habit of life as a pitiful and pointless existence can result in a need to escape it and find something better, the result being suicide. It is a refusal to endure the absurdity of life.

Thus, suicide comes as a response to the absurdity of life. It is making the realization that life has no inherent meaning and therefore is not worth living. Those who continue living also recognize this fact, but decide to embrace life and continue going on despite its inherent meaninglessness. 

Suicide emerges from the realization that life has no inherent meaning and the refusal of that absurdity rather than the acceptance.
