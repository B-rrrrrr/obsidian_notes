# Weariness of the self
Eines Besitzes überdrüssig werden, das ist: unser selber überdrüssig werden.

Our possessions will diminish over time. In other words, once we have something, we desire them less, and they don’t provide as much value for us any more. This is true for both physical objects and inner desires, such as getting a job or becoming famous. 

In life, no matter what we do, we are always in a state of possessing our bodies and our selves. It is one possession that we cannot ever escape from. But, because possession decreases its value over time, that means that the value that our bodies, our souls and our selves have, decrease over time. We become tired of ourselves. Once we’ve achieved the self that we desire, we possess ourselves entirely. The desire for ourselves vanishes and we become bored. 

In order to stop this weariness of ourselves, we must create the desire again. We must want to become something again to reignite the desire, the value, for the possession again. We must transform ourselves into something new. Through transcending the limits of ourselves, or even merely trying to reach those limits, this chase for the want invigorates the self and will make it seem as if we don’t possess the self that we want.

If we stop transcending ourselves and our inner limits, we will become tired of ourselves, for we will have possessed ourselves without desire for too long.
