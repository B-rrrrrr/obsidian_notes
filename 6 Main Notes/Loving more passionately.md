# Loving more passionately
We see love as a thing that needs to be eternal and singular. It is this way when we marry someone and is what is said by both partners. Cheating, getting a divorce, or simply falling out of love is seen as harmful and damaging. But, perhaps we have a twisted view of love and that there actually exists a much kinder, fuller and realer love than that which we follow currently.

By hoping for love, one is requiring something from someone else. One is expecting a reward for one’s efforts and feels deserving of them. If this person were to finally find love, their partner is bound to them to give them love and vice versa. Love becomes less an act of feeling and emotion but rather a business deal.

If one realizes though that love is temporary and linked to desire, affection and the knowledge that both parties are free in their choice, love instead becomes tied to oneself and one begins to love more fully. One does not expect something from the other person and understands without sadness that love can end at some point. But that is not important. It is loving in the now that gives one joy, not hoping for an eternal love with some kind of reward at the end, whatever that should mean.

This does not make one a selfish seducer and in fact it could be argued that the other way of loving is worse. While the former makes one not faithful to another, it makes both people free in choice and action and lets feelings dictate how to act to each other. It makes both people feel respected: they are being treated this way, because the other person genuinely cares about them. Eternal and faithful love will eventually break off for whatever reason and both partners will have to force feelings and force meaning unto their relationship, making their ties to each other a strong stone which they cannot escape from, whereas the other way of loving leaves one with a stone tied to oneself.

Loving while realizing that love is temporary lets one love another more fully and with more passion for another, bound to each other freely.
