# Reality is an appearance
There are two kinds of workers: one who sees their work as pointless and draining, and another who sees it as a productive and useful thing in their life. Both of these workers can be doing the same work, and yet their ways of living are quite different, but still real to them. Likewise, one lover can feel doubtful about the love from their partner, while the other sees it as deeply enriching. So how can there be two different realities within one objective reality?

Everything we perceive is filtered through our interpretations. Reality is not objective, and there are no positive or negative truths in life. Rather, reality is an appearance to us and is subjective. The office worker can see their job as productive or as tedious, even if the work they do is the same.

Initially, this realization can lead to despair. Life and meaning can be seen as an illusion and therefore seem pointless. Nothing in life has inherent significance and instead has been based on our constructions of reality.

However, it shouldn’t be seen in such a nihilistic tone. By consciously recognizing this fact and engaging with life through it, our interpretation and therefore also our meaning of life changes. By embracing it, we make life worth living, simply because life is that way. Life becomes worth living, because it we see it as such, and vice versa. 

Because reality is filtered through our perception of it, meaning and value arise from our interpretations of reality. Life becomes worthwhile, not because it inherently is, but because we choose to see it as such.
