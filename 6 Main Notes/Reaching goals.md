# Reaching goals
Ever had that feeling that having something did not equate to wanting it? Usually this experience is connected with buying something but can also be related to other experiences. Now what happens when a persons’ meaning of life was achieving this goal and then the realization hits that it doesn’t make happy as much as it was believed to make happy. What happens now? Depression, suicide, something else? Or can this be avoided in any way? 

Once a goal has been reached it is absolutely necessary to have something that transcends the meaning of life being reaching this goal. Because once the goal has been achieved life in that sense becomes meaningless and the self is lost. If there is nothing that has already been built up to fill that gap with meaning and purpose then one of two things can happen:

One, is that depression and despair fill up the self instead and the person devolves into a crisis. This person cannot find any sense of meaning any more and thus is lead to suicide. The reason for this intense depression is the fact that reaching the goal does not make a person feel as happy as they were told it would make them happy, and that the chase for it was actually giving them purpose and meaning in life.

The other thing that can happen, is that the person decides to put as much effort as they put in to obtain the goal to celebrate it. They engage with sex, drugs, spending money, partying, etc. and they lose themselves in the pleasure of celebration. However, these “celebrities” can only be in this state as long as they keep achieving the goals, which will eventually stop. Because goals can only be achieved through suffering, and this persons' life is only pleasure, pursuing the goal becomes an impossibility, leading to eventual despair.

Once a goal has been reached, there must be something that transcends the goal itself, for otherwise the self loses its purpose for existing.
