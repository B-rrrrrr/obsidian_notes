# Creation of nihilism
People mention how Nietzsche is the philosophy that one can only truly have after nihilism. I’ve kind of understood that way of thinking, since it was precisely this way of thinking that I developed after I was nihilistic. But this part from the Gay Science really shows how nihilism happens and what needs to happen afterwards.

Once one realizes that the world and universe have no meaning, it can be quite depressing. Plus, it creates a sense of active rebellion and pessimism against everything else that provides meaning. However, truly being against the meaning of the world requires complete and total acceptance. Otherwise, one still is demanding a meaning from something. And acceptance, that is a thing that is extremely hard to do.

At the end of the day, it is humanity who demands meaning and value from the world. But it is precisely this thought that is an error. The world itself has no meaning, but we still demand meaning from it. That does not make the world the problem, rather it is us and our thinking. Thus, it is from us that action is required, being either eliminating all our values and preconceived notions of the world or eliminating ourselves, by giving up entirely on life.

But, isn’t nihilism the result from both of these options? In the latter, one gives up on life entirely, but in the former, if one does not replace the void with something new, some new values based on ourselves and not the outside world, then one is also left with nothing. Therefore, once one makes the hard realization, it is almost nihilism that follows and that then gets adapted upon later.
 
Trying to find meaning in nothing results in action taken from the person whose realized this, the result of which is a void of nihilism.
