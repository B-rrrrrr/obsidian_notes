# Appearances can only change through new appearances
The way things appear is more important than what they are.

Names are given to things arbitrarily, as are the values and inherent meaning we assign to the name. Once named, these things will shape themselves gradually to that which they are named. Its appearance becomes reality. Only after they have been given an form to seem by can they then have meaning. 

Some may find despair in this, believing that they can destroy the meaning of these things since they are so easily created. Nothing seems real in that case. However, these meanings and values can only be changed by those who create. Only once given new names can things shape their values to others and become real or destroyed.

Appearances gradually shape what becomes real, and the power to change the appearance comes only from reassigning appearances and naming.
